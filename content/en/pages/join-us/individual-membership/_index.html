    Why Join the IDN?  Community and Support: Become part of a vibrant, like-minded community passionate about degrowth, where you can exchange ideas and receive support for your initiatives at a global level.  Personal Growth and Learning: Gain more direct access to a wealth of knowledge, discussions, and events that will deepen your understanding of degrowth and help you develop new skills and knowledge.  Active Contribution: Contribute to the growing impact of the degrowth movement by participating in various projects and activities, making a tangible difference in promoting sustainable and equitable living.  There are two ways to join the IDN as an individual:         Join through one of our member organisations. Individuals who are already part of an organisation that is a member of the network are considered members of the IDN. Once you belong to one of IDN's member organisations, you will be connected to the rest of the IDN through the people your organisation has selected to be its delegates.   (You may also want to browse this database of hundreds of degrowth groups and contact them directly to see how to get involved with them.)      Become an active member of an IDN Circle. If you have some time and you would like to dedicate it to helping shape the IDN and bring the degrowth movement to all corners of society, then you should join by completing the form below. Becoming a member of an IDN Circle requires individuals to:       Follow the aims and principles of the IDN   Engage in transparent internal communication with other IDN Circle members through an agreed upon platform (The IDN currently uses Matrix/Elementfor this purpose.)   Contribute to at least 2 hours per week to an IDN Circle     If you don't feel like joining you can still stay connected with the IDN!
