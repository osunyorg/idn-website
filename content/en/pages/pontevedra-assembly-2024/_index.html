        <p>This year, the assembly was organised by the IDN. Here is a summary of the most important outcomes of the Assembly and some of the follow-up that took place immediately afterwards. </p><p>Assemblies are the space for degrowthers, activists, practitioners, researchers, artists, IDN members, and allies to meet and exchange on how best to collaborate and spread degrowth ideas, policies and practices. Importantly. Assemblies are also a space to connect and share convivial experiences. </p><p>This year, 110 people joined us in person and over 40 folks online (some even got up at 3am to participate!)</p>

        <p>Proposal to change the definition of the Assembly<br></p><p>A proposal to change the definition of the assembly was supported by 61 out of 68 people who responded (80.3% total support). </p><p><b><br></b></p><p>The proposal defined The Assembly as a space for discussions, conviviality, feedbacking, brainstorming, strategising, building alliances, but not for decision-making. The proposal thus shifted the decision-making power of the Assembly to the General Circle of the IDN. </p><p><b><br></b></p><p>However, concerns were raised which will need to be addressed throughout the year. To name a few of these concerns: </p><ul> <li><p>If the assembly is officially not a decision-making body, then the name “assembly” becomes confusing, so it should be renamed. </p></li> <li><p>A body composed of all IDN members (either individuals, or organisations, or both) needs to persist for certain key decisions. Those interested in this question are invited to join the Legal Entity circle where this can be best explored</p></li> <li><p>The relationship between the IDN and the wider movement needs to be better defined.</p></li> </ul><p>The Organising Circle and General Circle will work together to resolve these concerns, along with all IDN members who wish to take part in these discussions.</p><p>Legal Entity </p><p>When asked whether the IDN should become a legal entity, a majority of participants strongly agreed (77%). </p><p>Vision, Missions, Aims and Principles </p><p>58 respondents made it clear that the Vision, Mission, Aims and Principles of the IDN that have been worked on over the previous year are not yet perfect, but good enough. Proposals for suggested changes were welcomed and encouraged.</p><p>Slogan </p><p>Mixed results were gathered on the elements suggested for a potential IDN slogan. Discussions will continue.</p><p>What can the IDN improve? </p><p>This open feedback question received many useful and great responses! Below is a brief summary: </p><ul> <li>Strategic and Structural Improvements: Decentralise from Europe, streamline strategy/bureaucracy, and increase focus and transparency. </li> <li>Engagement and Participation: Boost member activity, feedback, and diverse representation between assemblies. </li> <li>Communication and Outreach: Improve social media presence and offer multilingual support. </li> <li>Content and Thematic Focus: Emphasise decoloniality and dedicate time for in-depth topic discussions as well as strategy. </li> </ul><p>Circles </p><p>Almost all IDN circles hosted breakout sessions online, in person or hybrid. These were spaces to discuss their recent activities, their purpose and goals or projects for the future. Many also strategised or received feedback to integrate, moving forwards. </p><p>Below are some of our notes and internal thoughts about some of the discussions that took place during the conference. </p><p>Future Conferences </p><p>In 2025, the European Society for Ecological Economics conference (with which the assembly has coincided in recent years) will take place in Oslo, Norway from the 24-27th of June. </p><p>No date is yet announced for the Assembly. However, many have expressed a need for time spent together where strategizing, connection and organising can take place. </p><p>The IDN’s Support Group announced a vision for a week-long social forum type of gathering that could potentially take place in 2026 or 2027. However, many are keen to see a pilot social forum/strategizing space take place before or after the Oslo conference. This is something that could be mixed with the movement assembly, and it is something the IDN will take seriously and hope to help make it possible. </p><p>The Transformative Learning Circle of the IDN gathered vital feedback on how conferences could happen in the future and will share this with future organisers.</p><p>Delinking and Anti Imperialism </p><p>Many of us met with Emilia Reyes after her input at the Assembly to discuss how the degrowth movement can use our leverage in the imperial core to support, centre and strategise with the demands and movements of the Global Majority (sometimes referred to as the Global South) and marginalised communities. A WhatsApp group has been created where regular calls will take place to strategise, mobilise and find points of entry to push this agenda into the degrowth community. The Global South Working Group Circle may help steer and guide this working group. </p>
