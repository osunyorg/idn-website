        <p>Assemblies are the space for degrowthers, activists, practitioners, researchers, artists, IDN members, and allies to meet and exchange on how best to collaborate and spread degrowth ideas, policies and practices. Importantly, Assemblies are also a space to connect and share convivial experiences. </p><p>This year’s Assembly will take place just before the <a href="https://esee-degrowth2024.uvigo.gal/en/" target="_blank">International ESEE-Degrowth Conference in Ponteverda</a>, and will focus on building on what was started in Zagreb - that is to say, structuring actors and organisations of the degrowth movement in a more cohesive, collaborative and coherent manner. There will, of course, be room for conversations, debates and feedback on the direction, structure, and functioning that the IDN is taking, as well as time for the movement to connect, share, laugh and strategise</p>
