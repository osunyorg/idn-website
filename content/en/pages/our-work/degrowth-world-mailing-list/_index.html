    <p>  <br>The Degrowth World Mailing List is an open, moderated email forum that connects activists, researchers, and practitioners who care about degrowth. It was launched on the 31st of August 2015 by Ekaterina Chertkovskaya and colleagues after the  4th International Degrowth Conference in Leipzig  to keep the momentum of that gathering alive and strengthen degrowth ties across continents. In 2025 the volunteer administrator group invited the International Degrowth Network (IDN) to co‑steward the list, aiming to increase transparency and ensure wide access. The list is a practical space for sharing news, events, open questions, job postings, and calls for collaboration related to degrowth and allied movements. It helps weave conversations across regions and disciplines, making it easier to coordinate campaigns and spark new projects within the network.</p>  <p> At a Glance  <br>   <br>  <br> Started:  31 August 2015  <br>  <br> Subscribers:  804 (as of 19th Oct 2025)  <br>  <br> List address:  degrowth-world@lists.riseup.net  <br>  <br> Host service:   Riseup  <br>  <br>  <br> Homepage:   https://lists.riseup.net/www/info/degrowth-world  <br> </p>  <p> Who is it for?   <br>   <br> Students, scholars, artists, practitioners and activists interested in degrowth  <br> Grass‑roots groups and NGOs working on ecological and social justice  <br> Anyone curious about degrowth thinking and practice </p>  <p> How to Join?   <br>   <br>Subscribe:  Send a blank email to degrowth-world-subscribe@lists.riseup.net.
