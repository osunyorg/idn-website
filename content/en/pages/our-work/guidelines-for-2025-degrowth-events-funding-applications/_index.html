    Degrowth Events Fund 2025
  summary: >-
    <p>In 2025, the International Degrowth Network had the privilege of inviting the degrowth community to apply for a fund dedicated towards degrowth events.

  body: >-
    <p>Context  <br>   <br>The  International Degrowth Network  has received a 7500 Euro budget from the  Degrowth Conference Support Group  to be split between organisations that plan regional/thematic degrowth events, festivals, conferences, etc. Last year, seven local events received support. This year, the IDN’s Events Circle has been given the responsibility to handle this distribution in the spirit of increased transparency, democracy, and participation. Below, you can find all the information about how this process will work and the criteria that will be used to allocate these funds.</p>  <p> Who Can Apply?  <br>   <br>Eligible Applicants:  <br> Any organisation, group, or collective organising a regional or thematic degrowth-related event in 2025 or clearly aligned alternative frameworks (e.g., post-growth), provided the core principles of degrowth are respected.  <br> Previous recipients are allowed to apply, but priority will be given to new applicants.  <br> Event Focus and Format:  <br> Events should clearly incorporate the principles outlined by the IDN ( https://degrowth.net/about/principles/ ).  <br> Various formats are encouraged: conferences, workshops, festivals, local gatherings, and thematic meetings. </p>  <p> Funding Allocation Criteria  <br>   <br>Transparency and Fairness: Equal opportunity for all eligible applicants, with a priority focus on new & small groups, events in the Global South, historically underrepresented regions, and organised by marginalized communities.  Additional Considerations:  <br> The funding amount per event may be differentiated based on scale and need, and other additional consideration.  <br> Transfer of funds: The applicant must be a legal entity or be able to issue an invoice as an individual.</p>  <p> Application and Allocation Process  <br>   <br>Application Form:  <br> To request funds, applicants will have to fill out a simple form with the following details:  <br> Name, dates, contact details, bank details, event description, location, alignment with degrowth principles, estimated budget breakdown, anticipated audience size, and previous funding history (if applicable).  <br> Link to application form:  https://my.liberaforms.org/degrowth-events-2025     <br> Timeline:   <br> Applications open: 11th of April 2025  <br> Application deadline: 15th of May 2025 at 23:59 CEST  <br> Allocation Decision: Applicants will receive an answer by 15th-June (although a high volume of applications might delay this).  <br> Funds can be transferred as soon as possible after successful applicants are notified.   <br> Reporting and Accountability:   <br> Successful applicants will be asked to provide a short and accessible report outlining the use of funds for transparency and communication purposes.   <br> The format can be a brief-written summary, visual presentation, or video.   <br> Applicants are encouraged to use already existing documentation. </p>  <p>   <br>Fill in this short form to apply :)</p>  <p>Apply here! <br>https://my.liberaforms.org/degrowth-events-2025</p>  <p> Decision-Making and Process  <br>   <br>Democratic and Participatory Process:  <br> Applications will undergo a transparent process where anyone interested is invited to participate. All notes, decisions, and comments will be made publicly available online.  <br> The group will do their best to abide by the criteria and considerations set above.  <br> Conflict of Interest: Members involved in organisations that organise events and have applied for funding must openly declare conflicts of interest and abstain from deliberation related to their events.</p>  <p> Transparency and Communication  <br>   <br> All relevant documentation (calls, guidelines, decisions, reports) will be publicly accessible via the IDN website.  <br> Updates will be communicated openly through IDN channels to ensure accountability and participation. </p>  <p>   <br>If you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions, please do not hesitate to reach us at info[at]degrowth.net</p>
