    <p>Context  <br>   <br>In March 2025, the  International Degrowth Network  received a 7,500 euro budget from the  Degrowth Conference Support Group  to be split between organisations that plan regional/thematic degrowth events, festivals, conferences, etc. In 2024, seven local events received support. This time, the IDN’s Events Circle was given the responsibility to handle this distribution in the spirit of increased transparency, democracy, and participation. In the end, with help from the Support Group and Steady State Manchester we managed to raise and distribute over 13,000 euros to 15 groups out of 54 who applied from almost 30 different countries! Below, you can find all the information about how this process worked, our documentation, the outcomes of the events funded.</p>  <p> Application Process  <br>   <br> All relevant documentation (calls, guidelines, decisions, reports) will be publicly accessible via the IDN website.  <br> Updates will be communicated openly through IDN channels to ensure accountability and participation. </p>  <p>   <br>If you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions, please do not hesitate to reach us at info[at]degrowth.net</p>
