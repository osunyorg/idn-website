    <p>  <br>The Degrowth World Mailing List is an open, moderated email forum that connects activists, researchers, and practitioners who care about degrowth. It was launched on the 31st of August 2015 by Ekaterina Chertkovskaya and colleagues after the  4th International Degrowth Conference in Leipzig  to keep the momentum of that gathering alive and strengthen degrowth ties across continents. In 2025 the volunteer administrator group invited the International Degrowth Network (IDN) to co‑steward the list, aiming to increase transparency and ensure wide access.</p>  <p> At a Glance  </p>
