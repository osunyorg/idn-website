    Oslo Assembly 2025
  summary: >-
    <p>The 6th International Assembly of the Degrowth Movement will take place on the 23rd of June 2025 in Olso, Norway and online. There will also be pre-assemblies online which you can already contribute to! See more information below. </p>
  body: >-
    <p>Overview  <br>   <br>The International Degrowth Movement assemblies serve as vital opportunities to bond and share convivial experiences, encourage collaboration and organising, and make recommendations for degrowth transformations. The International Degrowth Network (IDN) is organising the 6th International Degrowth Movement assembly in a way that maximises inclusivity and effectiveness, taking stock of the previous year’s experience.  The proposed assembly design reflects the expectations and aspirations of IDN members, ensuring that it provides value in areas they care about, including knowledge-building, collaboration, and action. It also allows space for non-IDN members to connect, network and build their capacities for degrowth transformations. So that is why this year, we are shaking things up a little! The Assembly will involve three key phases:</p>  <p>Pre Assembly Survey - February–March 2025A currently ongoing pre-assembly feedback phase using a global survey to gather diverse perspectives to shape the foreseen assembly sessions. See more info on this below!</p>  <p>Online Assemblies - April 22 & 24, 3:00–6:00 PM UTC each dayTime-zone-sensitive online assemblies with interactive sessions to share needs, best practices, and strategies for degrowth.</p>  <p>International Degrowth Movement Assembly - June 23rd, 2025An in-person assembly, which will be a full-day event to further connect and collaborate in response to the needs and strategies identified during the online assemblies, as well as to celebrate diverse community achievements.</p>  <p>The 11th International Degrowth Conference and the 18th Conference of the International Society for Ecological Economics will take place after the Assembly in Oslo. Find out more.  </p>  <p> Pre-Assembly Survey  <br>  </p>  <p>The first <br>phase of the Assembly has started! The purpose of this is to gather diverse perspectives and provide ample time to synthesise feedback for informed discussions during the Assembly.You can contribute to the survey until March 2nd. </p>  <p>This survey is available in English, Spanish, Portuguese, and Chinese. Please help us by sharing it with comrades, friends, colleagues and peers:)</p>  <p>The working <br>group that is organising the 2025 Assembly looks forward to your answers!</p>  <p> Online Assemblies  <br>   <br>We are excited to invite you to the Online Degrowth Movement Assembly, a space for collective reflection, exchange, and action-oriented discussions to strengthen the degrowth movement.This is not an IDN assembly, but the IDN is taking the initiative to organise it with the support of both IDN members and non-members who are interested in engaging with degrowth. We also invite individuals and groups to host additional local, regional, or global degrowth assemblies throughout the year to explore the topics most relevant to them. We can share insights and experiences and exchange perspectives on how to host effective assemblies for degrowth.As part of our collective assembly process, you may be invited to take notes, document discussions, or support facilitation to help capture key insights and ensure everyone’s contributions are heard. This will enable us to build a shared understanding and create resources that can serve the broader degrowth movement. When you join the assembly we want it to feel like our movement, so please don't hesitate to get involved!We would also encourage you to host a local watch party, gathering people in your area to join the online assembly from the same space and same screen. This is a great way to spark local discussion, build community, and connect global ideas to local action. Find our guide to hosting a watch party here.Why join?This two-day assembly will focus on: <br>Degrowth in practice through policy interventions and place-based experiences <br>Supporting place-based and decentralised organising for Degrowth <br>Networking and collective empowerment <br>DetailsDate & Time: April 22 & 24, 3:00–6:00 PM UTC each dayThese dates and times have been selected based on our current capacity and availability. However, anyone is encouraged to organise additional Degrowth assemblies to address specific needs and topics.Languages: English (Spanish-speaking groups if volunteers are available)Agenda OverviewDay 1: <br>Presentation of IDN’s work and circles (brief overview)  <br>Group discussions on key topics (theory and practice, personal and organisational challenges, cultural transformation) <br>Special session: Degrowth and decolonial perspectives <br>Closing reflections, evaluation and next steps <br>Day 2: <br>Degrowth in practice, movements, and actions worldwide: Moving towards collaborative projects (activism, policy, events, communication) <br>Creative visioning exercise: The future of degrowth conferences <br>Closing reflections, evaluation and next steps <br>Register here (mandatory for participation): https://my.liberaforms.org/join-the-online-degrowth-movement-assembly-2025This assembly serves as a starting point for deeper conversations and actions that will inform the Onsite Degrowth Movement Assembly in Oslo, right before the ISEE-Degrowth Conference, and continue to evolve throughout the year, both within and beyond the IDN.</p>  <p> Online Assembly - Outcomes  <br>   <br>The online Degrowth Movement Assembly 2025 included presentations and many thematic group discussions. More specifically, the Delinking collective, formed during the ESEE-Degrowth Conference 2024, presented their key arguments and upcoming activities (watch the recording here). In addition, there selected contributions on activism, events, policy, and communication for degrowth were made (watch the recording here). Below is a brief overview of the key points raised in the group discussions. We invite you to read the full summaries and explore the minutes of each group discussion. Please note that these are not official positions of the IDN but rather reflect the concerns and ideas of participants from the 2025 Online Degrowth Movement Assembly (60-70 individuals and representatives from various organisations, IDN and non-IDN members). Sometimes, their views can even be contradictory. The key points raised, along with the evaluations of the online Degrowth Movement Assembly insights, will be used to structure the agenda for the on-site Degrowth Movement Assembly in Oslo (please contact us at info[at]degrowth.net, if you wish to get actively involved in the process).One of the thematic discussions was focused on bridging degrowth theory and practice, and two distinct perspectives emerged. In the European and North American context, the discussion highlighted local initiatives like Repair Cafes and community food projects as ways to practice degrowth, while also emphasising the need for systemic change and stronger links between grassroots movements and institutions. There was also concern about the degrowth movement unintentionally reproducing existing societal problems, such as patriarchy, exclusion and the marginalisation of the working class, even while aiming to challenge dominant systems. In contrast, the discussion around the Latin American context focused on the limits of using the term “degrowth,” which is often seen as abstract or negative, and instead stressed the need to connect with local struggles, address historical injustices and structural inequalities like colonialism, and build solidarity between the Global North and South. Another thematic discussion was focused on organisational challenges, such as lack of financial resources and time. It was a small group discussion that mainly revolved around the IDN. Participants discussed the value of keeping the network loosely structured to foster connection and flexibility, while also acknowledging the need for some coordination to support engagement and action. One key issue raised was the importance of compensating essential reproductive and organisational work. Relying solely on unpaid labour risks reinforcing existing inequalities, and the idea of a small, adaptable list of paid roles was suggested. These roles could be defined collectively.The group discussion on degrowth and cultural transformation focused on making degrowth more accessible and culturally relevant. Participants highlighted the need to move beyond academic discourse and embed degrowth within the organisational structures. A major challenge is addressing the dominant neoliberal narratives and overcoming fears that degrowth means losing modern comforts. Inclusive communication is key, along with reframing the language to work better for broader audiences. Emphasis was placed on systemic change, not individual blame, and on fostering collective reflection through different spaces where people meet, collaborate, interact, learn and share.The group discussion on events for degrowth revolved around ways of creating inclusive, interactive, and diverse degrowth events that not only promote learning but also shared action and community building. The group discussion on policy campaigning for degrowth focused on the need to bridge the gap between abstract visions and everyday concerns by offering hopeful, relatable alternatives to the current system. While national-level platforms remain weak, grassroots and municipal efforts could be focused on tangible issues like housing, transport, and working time to operate as entry points for political engagement and collective action.Overall, this assembly was a successful first attempt at organising a virtual Degrowth Movement Assembly. In the evaluations we received, participants highlighted both the urgency and complexity of building a political movement around degrowth. To move forward, they emphasised the need to confront power dynamics, amplify underrepresented voices, and connect bold visions with concrete action. Political education, inclusive structures, and alliances across media, unions, and local governments will be important. We are now moving towards the on-site Degrowth Movement Assembly in Oslo, building on the knowledge, insights, and reflections gathered during these days of the online assembly!</p>  <p> Recordings  <br>   <br>Check out recordings of the assemblies below!</p>
