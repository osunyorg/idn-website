        <p>We have Working Group Circles (in green on the diagram) that are organized by theme and Continental Circles (in red) that are organized by geographical region. We also have the Organising Circle (in blue) which helps the internal functioning of the IDN. Lastly, the General Circle (in purple) brings all the circles together and decides the strategy and aims of the IDN. Some Circles decide to create sub-circles to split up work into smaller teams. Two Circles “link” with each other via two individuals who belong to both Circles (double arrows). </p><p>  </p><p>The diagram below is dynamic: click on any circle to learn more about their purpose, responsibilities and domains. This structure is based on sociocracy, which you can learn more about <a href="https://degrowth.net/about/governance/" target="_blank">here <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a>.</p>
