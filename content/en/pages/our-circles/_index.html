summary: >-
  The IDN is organized in circles that link with each other by having two individuals in each circle (the arrows). We have Working Group Circles (in green) that are organized by theme and Continental Circles (in red) that are organized by geographical region. We also have the Organising Circle (in blue), which helps the internal functioning of the IDN. Lastly, the General Circle (in purple) bring all the circles together and decides the strategy and aims of the IDN. Some Circles even have sub-circles to split up work into smaller teams!

        <p>The diagram below is dynamic, so you can click on each circle and learn more about their purpose, responsibilities and domains. This structure is based on sociocracy, which you can learn more about in our website's "About" section. <br></p>
