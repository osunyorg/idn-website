    <p>A brief overview of the International Assemblies of the Degrowth Movement and of the birth of the IDN.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>For several years, the degrowth movement has been working persistently  <br>to build community and connection between groups and across borders -  <br>whether through annual Degrowth Conferences or the more informal Degrowth Assemblies that have often accompanied them. </p>  <p> Christiana Town Assembly 2018  <br>   <br>During the first International Assembly of the Degrowth Movement, participants created several <br> international degrowth working groups, such as Activists and  <br>Practitioners, Research, Communication, Networking, Artists and  <br>Designers, Narratives, and Education, in order to provide the degrowth  <br>movement with opportunities for both theoretical and practical  <br>engagement at the local and global level. </p>  <p> The Hague Assembly 2021  <br>   <br>At the following Degrowth Assembly <br> in 2021, attendees further explored the idea of a decentralised  <br>international network that would “move beyond the academic sphere” and  <br>“establish stronger strategic alliances with movements that are engaged  <br>in similar struggles.” This network was to be built on degrowth values  <br>of decoloniality, intersectionality, inclusivity, and global solidarity. <br> There was also a call for a “stronger international structure of  <br>support… that would promote campaigns with clear slogans” as well as  <br>support local groups, facilitate large actions, address a lack of  <br>continuity within the movement and help build a political identity. The  <br>2021 Assembly also discussed the practical considerations of how to  <br>balance leadership with democratic decision-making or how to apply  <br>governance systems, such as sociocracy, that were designed for  <br>organisations to a large network.  </p>  <p> Vienna Assembly 2022  <br>   <br>Degrowth groups continued to explore ways to build connection and  <br>provide the degrowth movement with a consistent voice without  <br>jeopardising its plurality and autonomy. However, this remained  <br>challenging due to the limited capacities of volunteer-run groups,  <br>unclear communication pathways, and unevenly distributed resources. In  <br>2022, the third Degrowth Assembly <br> decided to address these challenges directly and discussed the  <br>possibility of creating a coordination group that could help solve  <br>problems between different working groups and provide guidance on a  <br>spokesperson for the movement, budget allocations, and the  <br>implementation of new projects. Recognising the level of planning needed <br> for such an endeavour, the 2022 Assembly created an open collective  <br>entitled Organising the Degrowth Network, <br> or ODN, with the mandate of proposing a structure for an international  <br>degrowth network and outlining ways it could make democratic decisions  <br>on behalf of the movement.</p>  <p> Zagreb Assembly 2023  <br>   <br>During the following year, ODN members held numerous conversations,  <br>researched and evaluated different governing structures and  <br>decision-making processes, and sought and integrated feedback from  <br>within the degrowth movement. The ODN took inspiration from a renewed emphasis on strategy <br> within the degrowth movement and the plea to create “an intentional  <br>organisational structure that can facilitate more effective strategising <br> amongst degrowth actors, while also addressing problematic power  <br>dynamics, colonial attitudes, and patriarchal biases.” At the fourth  <br>Degrowth Assembly, the ODN presented a final draft of a proposal <br> that included a list of degrowth values that would steer the network, a <br> series of governing principles based on sociocracy, and guidance on  <br>using various tools to distribute power, such as how to create  <br>proposals, facilitate meetings, and assign people to roles. On  <br>August 28th 2023, nearly 100 individuals representing over 25 degrowth  <br>groups and organisations from around the world gathered to discuss the  <br>proposal and gave feedback on its principles, structure, and its place  <br>within the future of the degrowth movement. The Assembly concluded by  <br>adopting the proposal and officially launching the International  <br>Degrowth Network (IDN) with various Circles dedicated to its continual  <br>improvement. You can watch the entire assembly recording here.</p>  <p>   <br>For more information on the International Degrowth Assemblies, see this presentation or the Degrowth.info page: https://degrowth.info/en/degrowth-movement-assembly </p>
