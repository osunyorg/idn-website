        <p>For several years, the degrowth movement has been working persistently  to build community and connection between groups and across borders -  whether through annual Degrowth Conferences or the more informal <a href="https://degrowth.info/en/degrowth-movement-assembly">Degrowth Assemblies</a> that have often accompanied them. </p>

        <p>During the first International Assembly of the Degrowth Movement, participants created several  international degrowth working groups, such as Activists and  Practitioners, Research, Communication, Networking, Artists and  Designers, Narratives, and Education, in order to provide the degrowth  movement with opportunities for both theoretical and practical  engagement at the local and global level. </p>

        <p>At the following <a href="https://cloud.degrowth.net/s/xs32NYZga94rZsw">Degrowth Assembly</a>  in 2021, attendees further explored the idea of a decentralised  international network that would “move beyond the academic sphere” and  “establish stronger strategic alliances with movements that are engaged  in similar struggles.” This network was to be built on degrowth values  of decoloniality, intersectionality, inclusivity, and global solidarity.  There was also a call for a “stronger international structure of  support… that would promote campaigns with clear slogans” as well as  support local groups, facilitate large actions, address a lack of  continuity within the movement and help build a political identity. The  2021 Assembly also discussed the practical considerations of how to  balance leadership with democratic decision-making or how to apply  governance systems, such as sociocracy, that were designed for  organisations to a large network.  </p>

        <p>Degrowth groups continued to explore ways to build connection and  provide the degrowth movement with a consistent voice without  jeopardising its plurality and autonomy. However, this remained  challenging due to the limited capacities of volunteer-run groups,  unclear communication pathways, and unevenly distributed resources. In  2022, the <a href="https://cloud.degrowth.net/apps/files/files?dir=/Movement/ODN/Resources%3A%20past%20assemblies%2C%20D%26S%2C%20D%20Switzerland%20etc/Past%20Assemblies/Vienna%20assembly%202022&amp;openfile=153122">third Degrowth Assembly</a>  decided to address these challenges directly and discussed the  possibility of creating a coordination group that could help solve  problems between different working groups and provide guidance on a  spokesperson for the movement, budget allocations, and the  implementation of new projects. Recognising the level of planning needed  for such an endeavour, the 2022 Assembly created an open collective  entitled <a href="https://degrowth.info/fr/blog/organising-the-degrowth-network">Organising the Degrowth Network</a>,  or ODN, with the mandate of proposing a structure for an international  degrowth network and outlining ways it could make democratic decisions  on behalf of the movement.</p>

        <p>During the following year, ODN members held numerous conversations,  researched and evaluated different governing structures and  decision-making processes, and sought and integrated feedback from  within the degrowth movement. The ODN took inspiration from a <a href="https://www.degrowthstrategy.org/">renewed emphasis on strategy</a>  within the degrowth movement and the plea to create “an intentional  organisational structure that can facilitate more effective strategising  amongst degrowth actors, while also addressing problematic power  dynamics, colonial attitudes, and patriarchal biases.” At the fourth  Degrowth Assembly, the ODN presented a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/19HpNRpiplPdkW3y-APh_yU3JkYJG1O3W/view?usp=drive_link">final draft of a proposal</a>  that included a list of degrowth values that would steer the network, a  series of governing principles based on sociocracy, and guidance on  using various tools to distribute power, such as how to create  proposals, facilitate meetings, and assign people to roles. </p><p>On  August 28th 2023, nearly 100 individuals representing over 25 degrowth  groups and organisations from around the world gathered to discuss the  proposal and gave feedback on its principles, structure, and its place  within the future of the degrowth movement. The Assembly concluded by  adopting the proposal and officially launching the International  Degrowth Network (IDN) with various Circles dedicated to its continual  improvement. You can watch the entire assembly recording <a href="https://youtu.be/-2MoGbwa_HM" target="_blank">here <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a>.</p>
