        <p>This year, the International Assembly of the Degrowth Movement was organised by the IDN. Assemblies are the space for degrowthers, activists, practitioners, researchers, artists, IDN members, and allies to meet and exchange on how best to collaborate and spread degrowth ideas, policies and practices. Importantly, Assemblies are also a space to connect and share convivial experiences. </p><p>This year, 110 people joined us in person and over 40 online, with some even getting up at 3am to participate! Spirits were high, and the day was structured around convivial breaks. </p><p>  </p><p>The IDN was born from the previous Assembly, which took place in Zagreb, Croatia, and online in 2023. Therefore, this year’s Assembly dedicated a significant part of its time and attention to feedbacking on the direction taken by the IDN. Multiple breakout sessions made room for constructively discussing specific issues in smaller groups, but also for covering wider questions of strategy and related movement questions. </p>

        <p><b>Proposal to change the definition of the Assembly</b><br></p><p>A proposal to change the definition of the assembly was supported by 61 out of 68 people who responded (80.3% total support). </p><p>The proposal defined the Assembly as a space for discussions, conviviality, feedbacking, brainstorming, strategising, building alliances, but not for decision-making. The proposal thus shifted the decision-making power of the Assembly to the General Circle of the IDN. </p><p>However, concerns were raised which will need to be addressed throughout the year. To name a few of these concerns: </p><ul> <li><p>If the Assembly is officially not a decision-making body, then the name “Assembly” becomes confusing, so it should be renamed. </p></li> <li><p>A body composed of all IDN members (either individuals, or organisations, or both) needs to persist for certain key decisions. Those interested in this question are invited to join the Legal Entity Circle where this can be best explored</p></li> <li><p>The relationship between the IDN, the wider movement and the Assemblies needs to be better defined.</p></li> </ul><p>The Organising Circle and General Circle will work together to integrate these concerns, along with all IDN members who wish to take part in these discussions.</p><p><b>Legal Entity</b> </p><p>When asked whether the IDN should become a legal entity, a majority of participants strongly agreed (77%). </p><p><b>Vision, Missions, Aims and Principles </b></p><p>58 respondents made it clear that the Vision, Mission, Aims and Principles of the IDN that have been worked on over the previous year are not yet perfect, but good enough. Proposals for suggested changes were collected and will be integrated.<br></p><p><b>Slogan</b> </p><p>Mixed results were gathered on the elements suggested for a potential IDN slogan. Discussions will continue.</p><p><b>What can the IDN improve?</b> </p><p>This open feedback question received many useful and great responses! Below is a brief summary: </p><ul> <li>Strategic and Structural Improvements: Decentralise from Europe, streamline strategy/bureaucracy, and increase focus and transparency. </li> <li>Engagement and Participation: Boost member activity, feedback, and diverse representation between assemblies. </li> <li>Communication and Outreach: Improve social media presence and offer multilingual support. </li> <li>Content and Thematic Focus: Emphasise decoloniality and dedicate time for in-depth topic discussions as well as strategy. </li> </ul><p><b>Circles </b></p><p>Almost all IDN circles hosted breakout sessions online, in person or hybrid. These were spaces to discuss their recent activities, their purpose and goals or projects for the future. Many also strategised or received feedback to integrate, moving forwards. <br></p>

        <p><b>Future Conferences</b> </p><p>In 2025, the 18th conference of the  International Society for Ecological Economics and the 11th  International Conference Degrowth conference will take place jointly in  Oslo, Norway from the 24-27th of June. You can find out more about the  Oslo Conference <a href="https://isee-degrowth2025.no/" target="_blank">here<span class="sr-only"> - external link</span></a>. </p><p>No  date is yet announced for the next Assembly. However, many have  expressed a need for time spent together where strategizing, connection  and organising can take place. Thus, the IDN will work with the  conference organisers to ensure the 6th International Degrowth Movement  Assembly remains accessible to all.<br></p><p>The IDN’s Support Group  announced a vision for a week-long social forum type of gathering that  could potentially take place in 2026 or 2027. However, many are keen to  see a pilot social forum/strategizing space take place before or after  the Oslo conference. This is something that could be mixed with the Assembly, and it is something that the IDN intends to help make possible. </p><p>The Transformative Learning Circle  of the IDN gathered vital feedback on how conferences could happen and be improved in  the future and will share this with future organisers.</p><p><b>Delinking and Anti Imperialism</b> </p><p>Many  of us met with Emilia Reyes after her input at the Assembly to discuss  how the degrowth movement can use its leverage in the imperial core to  support, centre and strategise with the demands and movements of the  Global Majority (sometimes referred to as the Global South) and  marginalised communities. A WhatsApp group has been created where  regular calls will take place to strategise, mobilise and find points of  entry to push this agenda into the degrowth community. The Global South  Working Group Circle may help steer and guide this working group. </p>
