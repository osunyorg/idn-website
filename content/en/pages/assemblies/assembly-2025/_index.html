    First information  This year, the Assembly will involve three key phases: A pre-assembly feedback phase (Feb–March 2025) using a global survey to gather diverse perspectives to shape the foreseen assembly sessions. A time-zone-sensitive online assembly/ies (April 2025) with interactive sessions to share needs, best practices, and strategies for degrowth. An in-person assembly (June 23, 2025, Oslo), which will be a full-day event to further connect and collaborate in response to the needs and strategies identified during the online assembly, as well as celebrate diverse community achievements. We are looking for people that are members and non-members of the IDN to join the working group to:-Support the design and the distribution of the pre-assembly survey.-Analyse feedback to create meaningful breakout groups for the interactive online sessions.-Help plan and facilitate the online and in-person assemblies.If you are interested in joining the working group, please fill in this form by January 20. We will contact you after January 20 and invite you to an online call to organise the work for the assembly.https://my.liberaforms.org/working-group-of-the-degrowth-movement-assembly After the Assembly, there will be the 11th International Degrowth Conference and the 18th Conference of the International Society for Ecological Economics  https://isee-degrowth2025.no/
