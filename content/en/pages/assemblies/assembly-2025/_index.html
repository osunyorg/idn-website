    Oslo Assembly 2025
  summary: >-
    <p>The 6th International Assembly of the Degrowth Movement will take place on the 23rd of June 2025 in Olso, Norway and online. There will also be pre-assemblies online which you can already contribute to! See more information below. </p>
  body: >-
    <p>Overview  <br>   <br>The International Degrowth Movement assemblies serve as vital opportunities to bond and share convivial experiences, encourage collaboration and organising, and make recommendations for degrowth transformations. The International Degrowth Network (IDN) is organising the 6th International Degrowth Movement assembly in a way that maximises inclusivity and effectiveness, taking stock of the previous year’s experience.  The proposed assembly design reflects the expectations and aspirations of IDN members, ensuring that it provides value in areas they care about, including knowledge-building, collaboration, and action. It also allows space for non-IDN members to connect, network and build their capacities for degrowth transformations. So that is why this year, we are shaking things up a little! The Assembly will involve three key phases:</p>  <p>Pre Assembly Survey - February–March 2025A currently ongoing pre-assembly feedback phase using a global survey to gather diverse perspectives to shape the foreseen assembly sessions. See more info on this below!</p>  <p>Online Assemblies - April 2025A time-zone-sensitive online assembly(ies) with interactive sessions to share needs, best practices, and strategies for degrowth.</p>  <p>Hybrid Assembly - June 23rd, 2025An in-person assembly, which will be a full-day event to further connect and collaborate in response to the needs and strategies identified during the online assembly(ies), as well as to celebrate diverse community achievements.</p>  <p>The 11th International Degrowth Conference and the 18th Conference of the International Society for Ecological Economics will take place after the Assembly in Oslo. Find out more.  </p>  <p> Pre-Assembly Survey  <br>  </p>  <p>The first <br>phase is open, and you can contribute to the survey until March 2nd. We will <br>use its results to prepare the assembly sessions accordingly.</p>  <p>This is the <br>survey in English, and we <br>also have it available in Spanish, in <br>Portuguese, and in Chinese.</p>  <p>The working <br>group that organises the 2025 Assembly looks forward to your answers!</p>
