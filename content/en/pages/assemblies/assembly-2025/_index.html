    Oslo Assembly 2025
  summary: >-
    <p>The 6th International Assembly of the Degrowth Movement will take place on the 23rd of June 2025 in Olso, Norway and online. There will also be pre-assemblies online which you can already contribute to! See more information below. </p>
  body: >-
    <p>Overview  <br>   <br>The International Degrowth Movement assemblies serve as vital opportunities to bond and share convivial experiences, encourage collaboration and organising, and make recommendations for degrowth transformations. The International Degrowth Network (IDN) is organising the 6th International Degrowth Movement assembly in a way that maximises inclusivity and effectiveness, taking stock of the previous year’s experience.  The proposed assembly design reflects the expectations and aspirations of IDN members, ensuring that it provides value in areas they care about, including knowledge-building, collaboration, and action. It also allows space for non-IDN members to connect, network and build their capacities for degrowth transformations. So that is why this year, we are shaking things up a little! The Assembly will involve three key phases:</p>  <p>Pre Assembly Survey - February–March 2025A currently ongoing pre-assembly feedback phase using a global survey to gather diverse perspectives to shape the foreseen assembly sessions. See more info on this below!</p>  <p>Online Assemblies - April 22 & 24, 3:00–6:00 PM UTC each dayA time-zone-sensitive online assembly(ies) with interactive sessions to share needs, best practices, and strategies for degrowth.</p>  <p>Hybrid Assembly - June 23rd, 2025An in-person assembly, which will be a full-day event to further connect and collaborate in response to the needs and strategies identified during the online assembly(ies), as well as to celebrate diverse community achievements.</p>  <p>The 11th International Degrowth Conference and the 18th Conference of the International Society for Ecological Economics will take place after the Assembly in Oslo. Find out more.  </p>  <p> Pre-Assembly Survey  <br>  </p>  <p>The first <br>phase of the Assembly has started! The purpose of this is to gather diverse perspectives and provide ample time to synthesise feedback for informed discussions during the Assembly.You can contribute to the survey until March 2nd. </p>  <p>This survey is available in English, Spanish, Portuguese, and Chinese. Please help us by sharing it with comrades, friends, colleagues and peers:)</p>  <p>The working <br>group that is organising the 2025 Assembly looks forward to your answers!</p>  <p> Online Assemblies  <br>   <br>We are excited to invite you to the Online Degrowth Movement Assembly, a space for collective reflection, exchange, and action-oriented discussions to strengthen the degrowth movement.This is not an International Degrowth Network (IDN) assembly, but the IDN is taking the initiative to organise it with the support of both IDN members and non-members who are interested in engaging with degrowth. We also invite individuals and groups to host additional local, regional, or global degrowth assemblies throughout the year to explore the topics most relevant to them. We can share insights and experiences and exchange perspectives on how to host effective assemblies for degrowth.As part of our collective assembly process, you may be invited to take notes, document discussions, or support facilitation to help capture key insights and ensure everyone’s contributions are heard. This will enable us to build a shared understanding and create resources that can serve the broader degrowth movement. When you join the assembly we want it to feel like our movement, so please don't hesitate to get involved!We would also encourage you to host a local watch party, gathering people in your area to join the online assembly from the same space and same screen. This is a great way to spark local discussion, build community, and connect global ideas to local action.
