      1. Commitment to degrowth

        <p>We are aligned with and inspired by <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WWkdDpgHSoIQibuUPUSoo4i730zntofL" target="_blank">The Degrowth Declaration of The Paris Conference</a>, <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RFGJYKPhx_HrzMoXJKOTPvbu1mWXqf3l" target="_blank">The Degrowth Declaration of The Barcelona Conference</a>, and <a href="https://www.climateemergencyinstitute.com/uploads/Peoples_climate_agreement.pdf" target="_blank">The People’s Agreement of Cochabamba</a>. We understand degrowth as a transformative movement and a critical framework that challenges the prevailing growth-centric economic and social paradigms. Degrowth advocates for a reduction in material and energy used in production and consumption to align human activities with ecological limits and requires that this reduction is planned and democratic. A key part of this change is to ensure social justice and enhance well-being for all. Degrowth is not a one-size-fits-all concept but a mosaic of ideas, practices, and visions that draws from a variety of sources.</p>

        <p>We condemn oppression in all its manifestations, including colonialism, imperialism, classism, white supremacy, racism, sexism, homophobia, misogyny, ableism, capitalism, and any other form of discrimination based on gender, origin, spoken language, age, sexual orientation, class, ethnicity, religion, profession, geographical providence, or ability. We appreciate and encourage diversity and seek to increase our awareness of the intertwined and intersectional societal biases that impact and influence all of us. We are dedicated to overcoming these biases through continuous learning, constructive feedback, and collective action.</p>
