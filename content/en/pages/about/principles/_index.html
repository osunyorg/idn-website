    1. Commitment to degrowth  We are aligned with and inspired by The Degrowth Declaration of The Paris Conference, The Degrowth Declaration of The Barcelona Conference, and The People’s Agreement of Cochabamba. We understand degrowth as a transformative movement and a critical framework that challenges the prevailing growth-centric economic and social paradigms. Degrowth advocates for a reduction in material and energy used in production and consumption to align human activities with ecological limits and requires that this reduction is planned and democratic. A key part of this change is to ensure social justice and enhance well-being for all. Degrowth is not a one-size-fits-all concept but a mosaic of ideas, practices, and visions that draws from a variety of sources.2. Active resistance to oppression  We condemn oppression in all its manifestations, including colonialism, imperialism, classism, white supremacy, racism, sexism, homophobia, misogyny, ableism, capitalism, and any other form of discrimination based on gender, origin, spoken language, age, sexual orientation, class, ethnicity, religion, profession, geographical providence, or ability. We appreciate and encourage diversity and seek to increase our awareness of the intertwined and intersectional societal biases that impact and influence all of us. We are dedicated to overcoming these biases through continuous learning, constructive feedback, and collective action.3. Commoning participation  The success of our network as a community is dependent on the participation of our members. This means we commit to the equal and fair distribution of decision-making power within our organisation, and we actively prevent the emergence of hierarchies and concentrations of power.4. Open communication and transparency  We commit to transparency and inclusivity in all our communications. By openly sharing knowledge and decisions, we ensure that every member of the IDN has access to the information they need, free from gatekeeping. Our communication is guided by principles of respect, empathy, non-violence, and accessibility, fostering an environment where all voices are heard and valued.5. Care and cooperation  We seek to create a safe, supportive and convivial environment based on care and responsibility for each other and our work. We cooperate through the fair distribution of responsibilities and promoting a culture where everyone’s voice is heard. We aim to address tensions and conflicts in a constructive way that addresses everyone’s needs. Celebrating our achievements and prioritising well-being, we encourage members to communicate their needs, supporting effective and healthy participation. Our decisions consider the well-being of all beings and systems.6. Inclusive reflection and pluriversal knowledge  We embrace a wide array of perspectives on degrowth, valuing not only academic insights but also artistic, indigenous, and experiential knowledge. Our commitment is to foster an environment where every form of understanding enriches our collective actions and reflections. Members are encouraged to contribute in ways that resonate with their unique experiences and skills, furthering our shared vision.
