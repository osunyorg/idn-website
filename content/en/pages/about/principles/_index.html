        <p>We welcome everyone to participate in our community as long as they respect the Principles of the IDN. We respect and encourage diversity and are aware of intertwined and intersectional societal discrimination, which we actively stand against and will not tolerate, i.e. on the basis of gender, (ascribed) origin, spoken language, age, sexual orientation, class, ethnicity, religion, profession, geographical provenance or ability. We commit to working towards moving beyond these biases through active learning, valuing feedback and taking personal and collective action. We value open debate and constructive critique. We foster the ability to disagree and appreciate the opinions of individual members as long as they are not in strong conflict with the Principles of the IDN. We give everybody the chance to speak. We are anti-speciesists and encourage all our members to consider the needs of all living and non-living beings and systems in our decision-making process.</p>

        <p>Action, Arts, Practice and Reflection are an essential part of our culture. We actively schedule time for them. We are made up of practitioners, researchers, activists, artists, and others who subscribe to the IDN principles, and we strive to pull our efforts together aiming to further our common goals.</p>

      1. Commitment to degrowth

        <p>We are aligned with and inspired by <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WWkdDpgHSoIQibuUPUSoo4i730zntofL" target="_blank">The Degrowth Declaration of The Paris Conference</a>, <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RFGJYKPhx_HrzMoXJKOTPvbu1mWXqf3l" target="_blank">The Degrowth Declaration of The Barcelona Conference</a>, and <a href="https://www.climateemergencyinstitute.com/uploads/Peoples_climate_agreement.pdf" target="_blank">The People’s Agreement of Cochabamba</a>. We understand degrowth as a transformative movement and a critical framework that challenges the prevailing growth-centric economic and social paradigms. Degrowth advocates for a reduction in material and energy used in production and consumption to align human activities with ecological limits and requires that this reduction is planned and democratic. A key part of this change is to ensure social justice and enhance well-being for all. Degrowth is not a one-size-fits-all concept but a mosaic of ideas, practices, and visions that draws from a variety of sources.</p>

        <p>We condemn oppression in all its manifestations, including colonialism, imperialism, classism, white supremacy, racism, sexism, homophobia, misogyny, ableism, capitalism, and any other form of discrimination based on gender, origin, spoken language, age, sexual orientation, class, ethnicity, religion, profession, geographical providence, or ability. We appreciate and encourage diversity and seek to increase our awareness of the intertwined and intersectional societal biases that impact and influence all of us. We are dedicated to overcoming these biases through continuous learning, constructive feedback, and collective action.</p>

        <p>The success of our network as a community is dependent on the participation of our members. This means we commit to the equal and fair distribution of decision-making power within our organisation, and we actively prevent the emergence of hierarchies and concentrations of power.</p>

Celebrating our achievements and prioritising well-being, we encourage members to communicate their needs, supporting effective and healthy participation. Our decisions consider the well-being of all beings and systems.</p>

      6. Conviviality &amp; Autonomy

        <p>We align with an understanding of the word conviviality, which refers to a society in which modern tools are used by everyone in an integrated and shared manner, without reliance on a body of external specialists who control said instruments. Convivial tools are a condition for the realisation of autonomy, which is understood as a person’s or group’s right to fulfil their purpose independently and consciously according to our shared values and interests.</p>
