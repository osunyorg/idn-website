    <p>                   The IDN is organized into many Circles, each with specific purposes, responsibilities and domains. Explore the diagram and text below to discover which Circles exist, what they do, and how they connect.       </p>
  body: >-
    <p>Our Circles  <br>  </p>  <p> We have Working Group <br>Circles (in green on the diagram) that are organized by theme and Continental Circles (in red) <br>that are organized by geographical region. We also have the Organising Circle (in blue) which helps <br>the internal functioning of the IDN. Lastly, the General Circle (in purple) brings all the <br>circles together and decides the strategy and aims of the IDN. Some Circles decide <br>to create sub-circles to split up work into smaller teams. Two Circles “link” <br>with each other via two individuals who belong to both Circles (double arrows). <br> </p>  <p> To view a dynamic version of the diagram below click  here  (which will allow you to click on any circle to learn more about their purpose, <br>responsibilities and domains.)

There is a general circle in the middle, and coming off the central circle are others named Organising, Global South, Transformative Learning, Practice, Communication - with the subcircles social media and website; research, activism, events and then four continental circles. </p>  <p> The General Circle  <br>   <br>The  General Circle  of IDN oversees the network's overall governance and strategic direction, ensuring the principles and aims of IDN are met. It coordinates all the other circles and acts as the central hub for evaluating and improving IDN’s structure and operations. </p>  <p> Working Group Circles  <br>   <br>The  Research Circle  continues its mission to collect, store, and share degrowth knowledge, ensuring it is accessible and applied to a broader audience. They take care of updating and maintaining the  Degrowth Database .   The  Communications Circle  enhances the network’s outreach by refining its communications strategy to engage with labour unions, social movements, and political parties, and expanding social media efforts (give us a follow on  IG ,  Mastodon  or  LinkedIn !) Key projects have included the IDN's visual identity, our  slogan, and managing the content of the IDN’s websites (check out our  Explore Degrowth  resource hub!).  The  Global South Circle  aims to increase involvement from Asia, Africa, and Latin America within the degrowth movement.  They have developed a series of two  Beyond Degrowth  webinars, panels and interactive café-style chats. They have also created content that explores degrowth through a Global South lens, alongside workshops to teach effective communication of degrowth ideas.  The  Transformative Learning Circle  has developed a Transformative Learning for Degrowth Framework and is currently building a dynamic Playbook around it with specific resources, activities and processes that could be used in different cases and contexts.  The  Practice Circle  is focused on initiatives putting degrowth into practice.  Currently, they split their work into the following pillars:  <br> Associations and collectives that practice degrowth  <br> Private businesses and cooperatives into degrowth  <br> Policies and politics into degrowth   <br> Personal degrowth lifestyles  <br> The  Activism Circle  organises the  Global Degrowth Day  and plans in-person meetings to further unite activists. It focuses on advocating for degrowth through campaigns, intersectional activism, and building strategic alliances. IDN Think Tank: Policies and Politics  is our latest circle as an outcome of the Degrowth Movement Assembly 2025 in Oslo.   If we want to make degrowth a movement that matters, we can't stop at changing our habits or supporting local projects. We also need to shift the system itself. This circle is all about connecting the initiatives already pushing for policy change and getting those policy ideas into real political programmes. Want to join and help make that happen?    </p>  <p> Continental Circles  <br>   <br>The  Asia Circle  is focused on fostering informal, free-topic discussions about degrowth, tailoring these conversations to the specific context of Asia. The  Latin America Circle  is new, and it is still working on its priorities and first projects but will be focused on actively growing and strengthening degrowth initiatives in the region. Would you like to help them with this adventure? Reach out to info[at]degrowth.net! The  North America Circle  is becoming really active. Currently connecting the different existing initiatives and creating a viable alternative to the present dominating beliefs. Want to join and help amplify this movement?   The  European Circle  is dedicated to networking, organizing webinars, and influencing policies within the EU, while promoting more local degrowth initiatives.  </p>  <p>   <br>Want to stay up to date with European degrowth initiatives, events, opportunities and ways to get involved?

Some of this work is done directly by its inner circles:  Membership and Onboarding, Tech and Finance. There's always room to help out!
