        <ol> <li> <b>Create opportunities for international cooperation between degrowth-affiliated groups.<br></b>While there are many degrowth groups across the world, they are often isolated from each other or rely on informal and inconsistent methods of communication. Because of this, it is difficult to know the extent of the degrowth movement and who its members are. This leads to replicating work and to an inability to distribute resources and support fairly. Through an organised network, degrowth groups can work together and build on each other’s success. </li> <li> <b>Provide narratives for the degrowth movement that reflect the diversity of the movement.</b> <br>The lack of communication between degrowth groups makes it hard to agree on a shared set of narratives. Without shared narratives, the movement is at risk of being co-opted or used by those who don't share its values and becomes more susceptible to co-optation or use by regressive actors. Providing an organised network allows us to speak with greater legitimacy on behalf of the degrowth movement and to work together to make political statements that reflect diverse experiences.</li> <li> <b>Develop a cohesive set of strategies and actions that implement degrowth policies, proposals, ways of living, and organisations in all sectors of society.</b> <br>So far, the degrowth movement has lacked a space for creating strategies that consider various actors and circumstances. This can result in strategies that lack collaboration with allies from the Global South, labour, environmental, feminist, queer and decolonial movements who may not identify with degrowth and reinforce division between academia, activists, and practitioners. The IDN can provide spaces, structures and mechanisms to facilitate the discussion, evaluation and coordination of different strategies worldwide without jeopardising plurality. </li> <li> <b>Practise radical inclusivity and active resistance to systems of domination by creating a welcoming, respectful and caring community.</b> <br>The degrowth movement can’t address colonial, patriarchal and social biases if we do not create different ways of interacting. Without careful attention, we can easily replicate patterns of domination, especially when we feel the urgency to act quickly in the face of multiple crises. Furthermore, work within the movement is frequently done by those in privileged positions. Collectively, we can create a transparent and inviting structure that provides individuals with a clear entry point for joining, connecting with others and dispersing power within the degrowth movement. </li> <li> <b>Increase public awareness and build support for degrowth.</b> <br>Despite its recent increase in popularity, degrowth is still frequently considered a “marginal” idea. By working together, we can continue to promote degrowth as a realistic, desirable alternative. Our work at the IDN also demonstrates how degrowth-aligned groups can organise, build momentum, and provide an example of democratic organisation and participation that is central to the degrowth transition.</li> </ol>
