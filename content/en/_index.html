        <p>Degrowth suggests shifting away from economic growth as the main measure of society's success and well-being.</p><p>The constant pursuit of economic growth at all costs harms the environment, uses up resources, and creates social inequality.</p><p>Degrowth asks that we pay attention to other signs of well-being, like quality of life, fairness, access to basic needs and environmental sustainability. To do this, we need to rethink our current economic system, question the idea that economic growth is crucial, and consider different models that put human well-being, autonomy, and ecological health first. This will mean changing how we consume and work and what values our society prioritises.<br><br>The International Degrowth Network aims to create a community for like-minded individuals and organisations to work together and create spaces where alternatives can thrive.</p>
