<p>  Ecoist is an Eco-conscious movement motivated to reconnect the contemporary humans of the Indus basin with their roots and culture that was immensely Eco-centric. Our main strategy is to involve the common person in such campaigns and activities so that the seed of Eco-responsibility that nature has placed in all humans may sprout.  </p>
