<p>Post-Growth Singapore explores post-growth ideals and principles in the context of Singapore. We encourage relevant engagements and learning through a Telegram community and film screenings and run weekly Post-Growth Discussion Circles. For each Circle, we facilitate thematic group discussions, sharings from expert guest speakers, occasional field trips and more.</p>
