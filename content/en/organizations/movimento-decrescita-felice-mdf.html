<p>MDF is a plural and interconnected community of activists, practitioners, and researchers committed to Degrowth issues and, more generally, of all people who share the ideas, values and practices of the Movement. The Movement envisions and works for a world in which we collectively pursue the well-being of all living beings in harmony with the biophysical limits of the ecosystem. A world in which there is social justice and environmental sustainability, driven by interdependent, collaborative and inclusive communities and networks.</p>
