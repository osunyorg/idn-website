  <p>'Poems for Parliament' is a publishing house.  The sole author is me, Barbara Williams. All publications are free and relate to matters that connect with peaceful and equitable economic Degrowth.    I confer with a group of 50+ colleagues who are members of the Degrowthers Google email group.  We share research papers and opinions.  They assisted with the wording of the Global Aspiration for Ecological Justice, that we feel is pivotal in the paradigm shift to equitable Degrowth.</p>
