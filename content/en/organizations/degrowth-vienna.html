<p>Degrowth Vienna’s first objective as a collective is introducing the degrowth perspective into political and societal discourse around responses to the multiple crises in international academic discourses, political spaces and organizations/institutions in Vienna. Our second objective is to bring forward the engagement with the role of strategy within the scientific and activist discourses on degrowth and social-ecological transformation more broadly. Alongside these objectives, we strive to be self-reflective and critical of who comprises the degrowth movement and recognize the need for more internal diversity and intersectional approaches.<br></p>
