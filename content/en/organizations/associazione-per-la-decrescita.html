        <ul> <li><p>What are the main objectives of the group? AD is a political-cultural collective, active in the promotion of cultural activities, to spark reflection, public discussion, social and political action on topics related to degrowth</p></li> <li><p>Where are you active geographically? (country/cities): The Association has a decentralized organization, with a network spread across Italy and most of the communication taking place through online channels. It also has geographical groups, divided by regions/cities (Gruppo Campania, Friuli-Venezia-Giulia, Genova, Lombardia, Roma, Torino, Veneto). </p></li> <li><p>Since when have you been active? The Association started from a nucleus of people coming from a previous reality, the Antiutilitarian Association of Social Criticism, inspired by the French M.A.U.S.S. movement and active in Italy since 2004. After this experience, the Association for Degrowth was established in 2005 as a free association, a form under which it continued to operate in the following years. During 2011, in relation to the commitment of the organisation of the 3rd International Conference on Degrowth, Ecological Sustainability and Social Equity in Venice, it took a more recognisable structure and officially established itself as a Social Promotion Association. </p></li> <li><p>How many members are you? About 80 formal members, plus a few dozen other people who participate in local and thematic groups without being members</p></li> <li><p>How are you organized?  The Agora is the association's centre of political cultural elaboration and the place for the expression of the association's thoughts and proposals (e.g. the creation of new working groups and/or the launch of new projects). It meets regularly by telematic means and a few times a year in presence. It is composed of board members and working group leaders and is open to all members and sympathisers. The Board of Directors promotes and coordinates the activities of the local groups; it deliberates on all the main activities of the association, including the admission of new members, taking on board ideas and suggestions that may come from within or outside the association. It is formed by the contact persons of the territorial and thematic groups. At the first meeting of the new board of directors, held on 11 May 2023, the positions of President (to Mauro Bonaiuti) and Secretary (to Mario Sassi) were renewed. The establishment of the Secretariat was also confirmed, which includes, together with the President and Secretary, members Patrizia Bavo and M. Elena Bertoli.</p></li> <li><p>Main events/actions carried out: Education and vocational training is one of the main areas of action of the Association. In 2003 AD started the project “<a href="https://www.decrescita.it/alfabeti-ecologici/">Alfabeti Ecologici</a>”, in collaboration with Teachers for Future and other activists within the field of culture and ecology. The group has co-authored the “<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Jdy5wM9JCs5OnnZBn25hkaKLiyRmUYMK/view?usp=sharing">Letter for an ecological reform of the school system</a>”, in which they put forward ideas for cultural shifts on different levels. For instance through the initiative “<a href="https://www.decrescita.it/lezioni-ecologiche/">Ecological Lessons</a>”, whereby teachers, in a coordinated manner, halt the regular course of their classes to make space for dealing with ecological issues, in particular regarding aspects related to human-environment relations, through transdisciplinary lenses. Another area in which AD is particularly active, is the production of cultural content, including editorial material for the diffusion of practices and visions with a positive social and environmental impact. In 2023 the Association started the project “<a href="http://www.quadernidelladecrescita.it/">Quaderni della Decrescita</a>” (Degrowth Notebooks), a magazine published every four months and available for free online , that explores degrowth proposals and reflections through philosophical, scientific, practical and theoretical approaches. The editorial team is made up of a collective of researchers and activists and coordinated by members of the Association. AD is also closely collaborating with MDF and other activists to develop proposals for an ecological transition. With this objective, it has created a “<a href="https://www.decrescita.it/gruppo-transizione/">Transition Group</a>”, that works on the development and diffusion of political proposals for degrowth in the Italian public debate. Among the output of the working group is a list of degrowth policy proposals formulated in the document “<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/18BvHkAci3Hsi007HzOlUeljvND5glKiO/view">Uscita di Emergenza</a>”. Following this trajectory, since 2023 the group has started a discussion series denominated “<a href="https://www.decrescita.it/dialoghi-di-transizione/">Dialoghi di transizione</a>” (Transition dialogues), in which various activists and academics publicly presented their  degrowth or post-growth political proposals, followed by debates with the public. </p></li> <li><p>Plans for the future: To expand the current activities, with a specific focus in the communication area and in networking with local transformative communities.</p></li> </ul><ul> <li><p>Links to social media/website: <a href="https://www.decrescita.it/">Associazione per la Decrescita website</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/associazionedecrescita/">Instagram  </a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/AssociazioneDecrescita">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDPMeiAHwhOUIbiBDMqzhEQ/featured">Youtube</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ass_decrescita">X/Twitter</a></p></li> <li><p>Connections with IDN: Associazione per la Decrescita is part of the European Circle of IDN, while some of its members are in other Working Group Circles (Communication, Activism, Events, Research)</p></li> <li><p>Group photo: </p></li> </ul>

<p>The Associazione per la decrescita (Association for Degrowth) is an Italian organization composed of a collective of people active in cultural promotion, public reflection and discussion, and social and political action aimed at critically rethinking the twentieth-century paradigms of economic growth and development and exploring and promoting alternative visions of well-being and well-living, based on an idea of ecological, social and economic regeneration and sustainability.<br></p>
