  <p>Omagua is a grassroots association in Munich, Germany, dedicated to rethinking our relationship with the planet and each other. Born out of a shared desire for ecological balance and social justice, Omagua connects people who believe that a sustainable future can only come from collaboration, equity, and a deep respect for nature. We stand for degrowth—an intentional shift away from systems that prioritize endless economic growth at the expense of people and the planet—and work to create spaces where innovative ideas, diverse voices, and meaningful action come together.</p>
