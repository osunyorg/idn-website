<p>To help support and ensure the continuity of international degrowth conferences and their quality, we decided to create a collective constituted by representatives of all the former degrowth conference organising committees: the support group (SG). The SG is, of course, first focusing on the conferences. But it is also responsible for all the degrowth network's common tools which have been implemented and are needed for the success of conferences as a movement's physical home like communication tools, academic exchange, conference management platform, good knowledge and understanding of degrowth, its history, its actors and its challenges and also of its partners.</p>
