<p>  Our main objective as a collective is introducing the degrowth perspective into political and societal discourse around responses to the multiple crises in international academic discourses, political spaces and organizations in Vienna. Our second objective is to engage with the role of strategy within the discourses on degrowth.  <br></p>
