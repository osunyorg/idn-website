    <p>Newsletter  <br>   <br>https://lists.riseup.net/www/info/blue_degrowth_network</p>  <p> Working Languages  <br>   <br>English</p>  <p> More info  <br>   <br>What is Blue Degrowth?Blue Degrowth is a counter framework to hegemonic blue growth proposals and exposes contradictions in their uncritical assumption of the growth paradigm.In mainstream blue growth discourses, the ocean is constructed as a new economic frontier that is able to provide business opportunities and simultaneously conserve marine ecosystems in need. Market incentives coupled with technological innovation are supposed to allow the ocean to develop sustainably and benefit coastal communities along the way.However, as per profound degrowth research, the growth imperative underlying blue growth initiatives (such as seabed mining, intensification of marine tourism, industrial intensive marine aquaculture, among others) inherently contradicts its alleged goals of social and ecological wellbeing. On the ground research also empirically proves how ocean and coastal grabbing as part of profit-maximizing blue growth projects destroy marine and coastal ecologies and harm people’s livelihoods. It is to note that the destruction and harm is asymmetrically distributed globally and affects the Global South and the marginalized most.What do Blue Degrowth advocates do?Blue Degrowth advocates criticize and oppose the dominant, capitalist way of treating the oceans and explore alternative ways of relating to them. For that, Blue Degrowth scholars gather knowledge on the topic, voice their critique and alternative perspectives in both alternative and mainstream spaces, and learn from the knowledge, analysis and demands of coastal communities and territorial struggles against blue growth projects.People involved in the Blue Degrowth network are open to learning more about pluriverse imaginaries of the oceans, to developing alternatives and working together towards socio-political and ecological change.Learn more about Blue Degrowth here: <br>Hadjimichael, M.
