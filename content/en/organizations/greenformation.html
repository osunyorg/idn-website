<p>We consist of dedicated individuals with a diverse background ranging from ecology through economy and policy to geography. We focus on biodiversity and the well-being of society, sufficient energy use, socio-economic transition and transformation as well as behaviour change. For this we carry out research, we measure impacts, we provide advice and we do projects. We involve multiple stakeholders, we build dialogues and bridges. We bring experience and networks from both Western and Eastern Europe.</p>
