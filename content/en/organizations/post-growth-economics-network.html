<p>The Post-growth Economics Network (PEN) serves as a collaboration platform for researchers working on topics around post-growth economics. Our aim is to connect post-growth economists to build a strong network that can push for post-growth ideas – backed by economics research – in policy, education, and wider society.<br></p>
