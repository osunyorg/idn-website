  <p>Prosumer Economy Society was established in December 2015 by social entrepreneurs, civil society activists, researchers, scientists, ecology and human rights activists, and financial technology and sustainability investors. Its purpose is to conduct research on ecologically and socially fair business models, strengthen and promote best practices, and inform the public about the positive effects of the prosumer economy on nature conservation and a sustainable post-growth society. Since its establishment, the society has been conducting various activities to establish a direct relationship between ecologically and socially fair producers and prosumers in different regions of Turkey, sometimes with municipalities to establish a sustainable, circular, and fair economy. Today, within the scope of the society’s impact, there are over 780 producers and more than 25,000 prosumers.</p>
