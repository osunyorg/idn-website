  <p>The Ecozoic represents a vision for the future founded on mutually enhancing relationships between human societies and the global community of life through the lens of social justice. Leadership for the Ecozoic (L4E) is a global partnership based at McGill University and the University of Vermont working toward that vision by: (1) advancing transdisciplinary scholarship in select doctoral programs to educate and empower new leaders for the Ecozoic; (2) co-creating a global research-to-action network to heal and restore Earth’s life support systems and to define and foster a different mode of inhabiting the Earth, respectful of life’s myriad ways of knowing and being; and (3) mobilizing and focusing higher education resources and communication on mitigating multi-faceted, human-induced, planetary declines in life support capacity.</p>
