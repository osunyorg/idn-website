  <p>This network is a place for those who want to or are already acting, organising and campaigning for a degrowth world. We gather locally and nationally (online) every month or so to learn from each other, share updates and discuss plans and projects. The network is like a skeleton, or an ecosystem, providing spaces and forums for those interested in and enacting degrowth to come together and discuss, disagree and organise.</p>
