    Asian Newsletter - 2025
  summary: >-
    <p>Welcome to the very first issue of the Degrowth Asia newsletter!  </p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>However you made your way to this newsletter, allow us to briefly explain what degrowth is. Simply put, degrowth is the idea that our economies should be reduced materially in order for our planet to stay within ecological limits, while everyone can still have a good life. Degrowth is an idea that is still relatively marginal, but is gaining traction globally as we reckon with various socio-ecological crises. And we, Degrowth Asia, are a collective of people from or currently living in Asia in various fields and spheres like academia, nonprofits, business, agriculture, and more. We first formed as a circle of the International Degrowth Network (IDN) in Apr 2024 and have been meeting regularly to discuss how degrowth relates to different topics, but in an Asian context. In one meeting, we decided to start this quarterly newsletter so that we can share our learnings with a wider audience and hopefully encourage more to join us - check the bottom of this email for how you can do so! What does it mean to talk about degrowth in Asia? As the largest continent and home to about 60% of the world's population, Asia contains a dazzling multitude of cultures, histories, and ways of being with nature and each other. Naturally, this means that it is also host to many extremes and contradictions. Recently, the  World Sufficiency Lab  released a tool that maps when each country should reach zero carbon emissions, based on the landmark  ICJ advisory opinion  that all countries are obliged to make adequate contributions to limit global warming to 1.5ºC that take their historical responsibilities into account. Zooming into Asia, we see that while countries like Russia, Japan, and Singapore already exceeded their fair carbon budget before the turn of the millennium, others such as India, Indonesia and the Philippines still have many decades to go before exhausting theirs. It is clear, then, that there cannot be a single version of degrowth that applies to all of these countries.</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>Zero Carbon Timeline: Countries' Legal Obligations Under the ICJ July 2025 Ruling (by Capability), World Sufficiency Lab <br>   <br>Here is where it is necessary to highlight an important conversation in degrowth that recognizes global and regional inequities: that rich countries must degrow so that the others have space to determine their own paths forward. And as  Max Ajl said in the recent ISEE-Degrowth conference  in Oslo, degrowth is not only about scaling down production and consumption within rich countries, but also resisting the imperialism that continues to constrain the development of so called 'developing countries', through genocides, wars, sanctions, debt regimes, unequal trade terms, and other restrictions. To do this, we need to learn from past movements to build solidarity across countries in the global majority, such as the  1955 Bandung Conference  in Indonesia where leaders of many newly-independent Asian and African states met, representing more than half of the world's population, and discussed ways to promote cooperation among them and protect their sovereignty against colonialism and imperialism. However, as many of us who have been in degrowth spaces have realised, Asia does not often come up in the literature or related events. Surely the policies that are being proposed for Europe and North America cannot be applied wholesale to countries in Asia. Many Asian communities already have a conception of what it means to live a good life within ecological limits, even if they may not deploy the word "degrowth". Our intention is to use this newsletter as a space to explore what degrowth may look like in our histories, present, and futures, and make visible the pluriverse of alternatives to the capitalist growth-driven order. In each newsletter, we will try to give you a sense of what's going on with regards to degrowth in Asia. We will start with a reflection on particular degrowth topics, likely inspired by some of our circles, before highlighting some degrowth-related news, events, and ways you can get involved in the movement. Finally, we will also feature a member and their work, so you can get to know 'real people' who are active in the degrowth space in Asia. If you find this useful, please share this newsletter with people you know, and we welcome you to contribute to our newsletter in any way! In doing so, we hope we can exchange and collaboratively nurture more degrowth ideas that would flourish on the soils of the wide variety of places we call home. With solidarity and hope, The Degrowth Asia Team</p>  <p> Updates from Degrowth Asia  <br>   <br>Since April 2024, the group has been meeting once a month to share thoughts and ideas about various aspects of degrowth from the perspectives of different Asian regions:  <br> Exploring the concept of a good life in different Asian philosophies, and the role of religions in changing the narratives around growth. We had a discussion with  Professor Todd LeVasseur  about the intersection between traditional spirituality, religious philosophies and environmentalism.  <br> Watching the documentary " Rumah Penantian " about a neighborhood in Kuala Lumpur organizing to stop a development project in their community. We heard our guest  SF  and group members share similar stories of bottom-up organizing against development in Hong Kong, Kazakhstan, and South Korea.  <br> Discussing features of traditional medicine and alternative health care models (such as the barefoot doctors,  community acupuncture ...) as compatible with degrowth.  <br> In terms of meetings where we discussed more administrative aspects, we have talked about joining the IDN, publishing a newsletter (this one!), and organising a regional gathering in 2026 - please contact us if you would like to be involved in any of these things!  </p>  <p> Featured member: Yuichi  <br>   <br>How would you describe your 'journey' with degrowth so far? My journey with degrowth has been deeply thought-provoking and has significantly shaped my critical thinking. It continues to inspire how I frame my PhD research on the intersections of degrowth and health. How was your experience at the ISEE-degrowth conference this year? This was my first time attending the conference, and I truly enjoyed it! I presented my research on demographic change and degrowth and received valuable feedback that will strengthen my work. While I already knew some participants, meeting them in person was a highlight. The conference offered not only inspiring sessions but also moments of connection over meals, dancing, and time spent in nature. What do you think about degrowth in the context of Asia? Degrowth in Asia comes with unique challenges and possibilities. In my country, Japan, prolonged economic stagnation, rapid demographic ageing and shrinking, and ongoing ecological breakdown may create conditions for serious discussions on designing a post-growth economy.  Moreover, Asia has a wealth of rich environmental philosophies and traditions that remain under-represented in degrowth discourse. We hope to bring more of these perspectives into future newsletters. If there is just one thing you wish people knew more about in relation to degrowth, what is it? That degrowth is not about "less" for its own sake, but about rethinking prosperity and wellbeing beyond GDP. It's about creating societies where care, community, and ecological balance take precedence over endless consumption and extraction. Are you part of any exciting initiatives (besides Degrowth Asia) that you would like to share? Yes! I am part of Tokyo Snails, Japan. With the fund from IDN, we are preparing for degrowth-related events tentatively scheduled in mid-December 2025! I am also involved in the  Tokyo Forum  hosted by the University of Tokyo. The theme of the year is "Rethinking Capitalism".  </p>  <p> Upcoming events  <br>   <br>One of our members, Atanu, is hosting  Nabaanna Utsav: Harvest of Enough , a two-day celebration of community, culture, and sustainability on 6 and 7 December in Eriamara, West Bengal, India! Here is a message from Atanu:  "I warmly invite you to join us, share inspiring talk and of course experience the taste of Bengal's culture, and co-create this journey. I will be glad if you join with us 🙏 Accommodation will be simple in our community houses (mud houses, common toilets, no single rooms) to help you experience our way of life." If you are interested to attend, please email Atanu at  ghoshatanu30@gmail.com  before 20 November. Other events happening in Asia include: Degrowth Advocacy: An Experience Sharing Forum;  Taipei (Taïwan); November;  Mutica In Action 脱成長祭り・Degrowth Matsuri ; Tokyo (Japan); Autumn - Winter 2025;  Degrowth Japan Degrowth as Sovereignty for the Periphery ; Jaipur (India); 15-20th December;  Peoples of Himalaya Academic Discourses Network</p>  <p> Interested in joining as a member of IDN?  <br>   <br>If you like what you read and want to further help building this network and bringing Degrowth to all the corners of our society, join the International Degrowth Network and the tool where we work, Matrix: Join as an individual  or  Join as an association Feel free to share this email with other people or groups that may be interested.
