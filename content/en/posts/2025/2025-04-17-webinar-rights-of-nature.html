    <p>Rights of Nature and Degrowth - two facets of the same ‘whole’  <br>Rights of Nature is a paradigm shift from seeing and treating Nature as a resource and an object in law that is there (mainly) for human use and without a voice of her own in the human controlled legal system towards recognising and respecting Nature’s right to exist, live, thrive and evolve naturally – in law as a legal subject and with her own in and of itself right to protection and existence. One of the current worst offenders when it comes to the murder of living entities is the rampant extractivism which itself is a result of the incessant ‘need’ for material growth. Degrowth as a paradigm is the antithesis of quantitative growth for the sake of profit and materialism and is therefore the prerequisite for the cessation of human caused destruction of life and the planet Earth herself. Degrowth is, therefore, absolutely essential if we are to halt Nature and living communities murder and destruction, to change the direction in which the human societies g(r)o(w) and ensure that the rights of Nature to just simply exist on a healthy home - are respected.The Transition Town movement, itself built on the holistic ecological design of Permaculture is a practical, lived on the ground expression of degrowth which is based on the simple ethics of living in harmony and respecting Nature’s right to life.</p>  <p> Zoe Lujic  <br>Zoe Lujic (pictured left) holder of MSc in Environmental Studies, Rights of Nature expert and advocate, founder of Earth Thrive  organisation and Balkan Centre for the Rights of Nature - BCPP (instagram). She founded and ran an award winning urban permaculture organisation in London in mid 2000 and attended the first ever Transition Towns community organising course in London in 2007. </p>  <p>headshot of Zoe Lujic <br>Image credit: Zoe Lujic <br> Nina Djukanovic   <br>Nina Djukanovic, a Balkan Centre for the Rights of Nature adviser, is a PhD student at the University of Oxford who focuses her research on the resistance against lithium mining in Serbia and the world.
