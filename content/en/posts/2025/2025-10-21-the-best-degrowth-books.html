    The Best Degrowth Books - Recommendations from our Members
  summary: >-
    <p>We asked IDN volunteers to share their favourite books on degrowth - this is what they recommend!</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>Many people in the degrowth space got involved after exposure to a particular book. And whilst everyone will have a different journey towards degrowth and post-growth worlds, we wanted to share some thoughts on what are the best degrowth books out there. So - we asked volunteers at the IDN to share their favourite books on Degrowth. We did this for two reasons - the first being, we wanted to create an article here that helps signpost some great books on this topic, and secondly, we wanted an excuse to showcase the thoughts of our brilliant volunteers. At a time when many are choosing to make use of AI content, we instead wanted to try crowdfunding this article instead, showcasing just a few of the very real humans behind the degrowth movement.</p>  <p> Book 1 - Radical Abundance: How to Win A Green Democratic Future  <br>   <br>Authors : Kai Heron, Keir Milburn, Bertie Russell <br> Comments on this book: Everyone in the IDN should read this essential contribution to our theories of transition. It doesn't just sketch the contours of an economy of radical abundance—it provides a roadmap for getting there, grounded in dialectical materialism and conjunctural analysis. Within degrowth, we often struggle to move from imagining social-ecological utopias to figuring out how to make them a reality. Kai, Keir, and Bert are clear-eyed about the obstacles facing us, as well as the difficulty inherent to building the class power and popular protagonism required to overcome them. Championed by scholars including Jason Hickel, the concept of radical abundance is essential for moving degrowth from theory to practice. Here, for the first time, we have a book-length treatment of the subject. Don't waste your time with Derek Thompson and Ezra Klein; this is the future we deserve.</p>  <p>Radical Abundance book cover <br>PlutoBooks <br>   <br>Book recommended by  Charles Stevenson , a Doctoral researcher & volunteer in the IDN Comms Circle.</p>  <p>Charles Stevenson <br>Charles Stevenson <br> Book 2 - Everyday Utopia: What 2,000 Years of Wild Experiments Can Teach Us About the Good Life  <br>   <br>Author : </p>  <p>Kristen R. Ghodsee  Comments on this book:  </p>  <p>While not explicitly about degrowth, the book explores better ways of social organizing, criticizes capitalism, and interrogates ideas such as patriarchy, monogamy, and single family living. I found the historical examples of utopian living reassuring and inspiring-what the degrowth movement is trying to do is not something new, but rather it's the latest example of people trying to live better, happier lives. </p>  <p> </p>  <p>Everyday Utopia book cover <br>Kristen R Ghodsee <br>   <br>Book recommended by  Lily Edelman-Gold , a climate change professional and volunteer in the IDN Practice circle and Policy/Politics circle. </p>  <p>Lily Edelman-Gold</p>  <p> Book 3 - Free to Serve  <br>   <br>Author : </p>  <p>Jeroen J van Beele</p>  <p> Comments on this book:   It is a concise overview of the memes that make up our new economy starting from Krishnamurti: When you are free, you have no choice the booklet can be downloaded for free from  Free to Serve</p>  <p>Free to  Serve illustration <br>Free to Serve <br>   <br>Book (or "booklet") recommended by  Jeroen J van Beele , SAS and Credit Risk expert and volunteer in the Comms Circle at the IDN.</p>  <p>Jeroen J van Beele</p>  <p> Book 4 - The Future Is Degrowth: A Guide to a World beyond Capitalism  <br>   <br>Authors : Matthias Schmelzer, Andrea Vetter and Aaron Vansintjan Comments on this book:  The introductory chapter is particularly good at debunking the various misrepresentations and misunderstandings of degrowth. Degrowth, they note, is both a critique and a proposal, and later sections explore both aspects.  They cover the critiques of growth that come together in degrowth, definitions of degrowth, offering their own, the policy ingredients implied by degrowth and finally they attempt to say how that can come about. As they say, "...to start this journey, we need a broad but unified 'movement of movements' for life and against capitalist growth to confidently take the first steps along this path of transformation." I don't think there is a better introduction to degrowth.</p>  <p>The future is degrowth <br>Verso Books <br>   <br>Book recommended by  Mark Burton , an  Independent Scholar-Activist and volunteer in the IDN's Degrowth (conferences) Support Group circle. </p>  <p>Mark Burton <br>Mark Burton <br> Book 5 - Revolution in Rojava: Democratic Autonomy and Women's Liberation in Syrian Kurdistan  <br>   <br>Authors : Michael Knapp, Anja Flach, Ercan Ayboga  Comments on this book:  What I like: David Graeber always held up Rojava as one of the clearest examples of what resilient post growth communities could look like, even in the face of the toughest conditions. This book shows why. It details the incredible levels of sufficiency and direct democracy that local communities can achieve when autocratic/capitalist/misogynist power structures and their restraints are removed.</p>  <p>Revolution in Rojava book cover <br>Pluto Books <br>   <br>Book recommended by Nicholas Owen, a Sustainability & Content Consultant and volunteer Practice Circle Representative at the IDN.</p>  <p>Nicholas Owen</p>  <p> Recommended Fiction Degrowth Books  <br>   <br>One of our members (Félix Garnier) wanted to recommend some Degrowth fiction books - and who are we to deny him this opportunity? So, here is not one but four (!) recommended fiction books. Sidenote that reading fiction can be a more appealing form of being introduced to the topic of degrowth and postgrowth topics for many people, when afterall we do require a good imagination to see beyond a growth-obsessed world! </p>  <p> Book 6: Ecotopía   </p>
