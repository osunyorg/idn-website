    The Best Degrowth Books - Recommendations from our Members
  summary: >-
    <p>We asked IDN volunteers to share their favourite books on degrowth - this is what they recommend!</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>Many people in the degrowth space got involved after exposure to a particular book. And whilst everyone will have a different journey towards degrowth and post-growth worlds, we wanted to share some thoughts on what are the best degrowth books out there. So - we asked volunteers at the IDN to share their favourite books on Degrowth. We did this for two reasons - the first being, we wanted to create an article here that helps signpost some great books on this topic, and secondly, we wanted an excuse to showcase the thoughts of our brilliant volunteers. At a time when many are choosing to make use of AI content, we instead wanted to try crowdfunding this article instead, showcasing just a few of the very real humans behind the degrowth movement.</p>  <p> Book 1 - Radical Abundance: How to Win A Green Democratic Future  <br>   <br>Authors : Kai Heron, Keir Milburn, Bertie Russell <br> Comments on this book: Everyone in the IDN should read this essential contribution to our theories of transition. It doesn't just sketch the contours of an economy of radical abundance—it provides a roadmap for getting there, grounded in dialectical materialism and conjunctural analysis. Within degrowth, we often struggle to move from imagining social-ecological utopias to figuring out how to make them a reality. Kai, Keir, and Bert are clear-eyed about the obstacles facing us, as well as the difficulty inherent to building the class power and popular protagonism required to overcome them. Championed by scholars including Jason Hickel, the concept of radical abundance is essential for moving degrowth from theory to practice. Here, for the first time, we have a book-length treatment of the subject. Don't waste your time with Derek Thompson and Ezra Klein; this is the future we deserve.</p>  <p>Radical Abundance book cover <br>PlutoBooks <br>   <br>Book recommended by  Charles Stevenson , a Doctoral researcher & volunteer in the IDN Comms Circle.</p>  <p>Charles Stevenson <br>Charles Stevenson <br> Book 2 - Everyday Utopia: What 2,000 Years of Wild Experiments Can Teach Us About the Good Life  <br>   <br>Author : </p>  <p>Kristen R. Ghodsee  Comments on this book:  </p>  <p>While not explicitly about degrowth, the book explores better ways of social organizing, criticizes capitalism, and interrogates ideas such as patriarchy, monogamy, and single family living. I found the historical examples of utopian living reassuring and inspiring-what the degrowth movement is trying to do is not something new, but rather it's the latest example of people trying to live better, happier lives. </p>  <p> </p>  <p>Everyday Utopia book cover <br>Kristen R Ghodsee <br>   <br>Book recommended by  Lily Edelman-Gold , a climate change professional and volunteer in the IDN Practice circle and Policy/Politics circle. </p>  <p>Lily Edelman-Gold</p>  <p> Book 3 - Free to Serve  <br>   <br>Author : </p>  <p>Jeroen J van Beele</p>  <p> Comments on this book:   It is a concise overview of the memes that make up our new economy starting from Krishnamurti: When you are free, you have no choice the booklet can be downloaded for free from  Free to Serve</p>  <p>Free to  Serve illustration <br>Free to Serve <br>   <br>Book (or "booklet") recommended by  Jeroen J van Beele , SAS and Credit Risk expert and volunteer in the Comms Circle at the IDN.</p>  <p>Jeroen J van Beele</p>  <p> Book 4 - The Future Is Degrowth: A Guide to a World beyond Capitalism  <br>   <br>Authors : Matthias Schmelzer, Andrea Vetter and Aaron Vansintjan Comments on this book:  The introductory chapter is particularly good at debunking the various misrepresentations and misunderstandings of degrowth. Degrowth, they note, is both a critique and a proposal, and later sections explore both aspects.  They cover the critiques of growth that come together in degrowth, definitions of degrowth, offering their own, the policy ingredients implied by degrowth and finally they attempt to say how that can come about. As they say, "...to start this journey, we need a broad but unified 'movement of movements' for life and against capitalist growth to confidently take the first steps along this path of transformation." I don't think there is a better introduction to degrowth.</p>  <p>The future is degrowth <br>Verso Books <br>   <br>Book recommended by  Mark Burton , an  Independent Scholar-Activist and volunteer in the IDN's Degrowth (conferences) Support Group circle. </p>  <p>Mark Burton <br>Mark Burton <br> Book 5 - Revolution in Rojava: Democratic Autonomy and Women's Liberation in Syrian Kurdistan  <br>   <br>Authors : Michael Knapp, Anja Flach, Ercan Ayboga  Comments on this book:  What I like: David Graeber always held up Rojava as one of the clearest examples of what resilient post growth communities could look like, even in the face of the toughest conditions. This book shows why. It details the incredible levels of sufficiency and direct democracy that local communities can achieve when autocratic/capitalist/misogynist power structures and their restraints are removed.</p>  <p>Revolution in Rojava book cover <br>Pluto Books <br>   <br>Book recommended by Nicholas Owen, a Sustainability & Content Consultant and volunteer Practice Circle Representative at the IDN.</p>  <p>Nicholas Owen</p>  <p> Book 6 - Less is More: How Degrowth Will Save the World  <br>   <br>Author : Jason Hickel Comments on this book:  I really, really, really liked "Less is More" by Jason Hickel. I learned a lot about the history of capitalism, commons, enclosure/privatization, religion and more. (Matt's addition: I too liked this book a lot. I would describe it as being my "gateway drug to the world of Degrowth" - it is a nice, fairly gentle introduction to the topic).</p>  <p>Less is More book cover <br>Jason Hickel's website <br> Recommended Fiction Degrowth Books  <br>   <br>One of our members (Félix Garnier) wanted to recommend some Degrowth fiction books - and who are we to deny him this opportunity? So, here is not one but four (!) recommended fiction books. Sidenote that reading fiction can be a more appealing form of being introduced to the topic of degrowth and postgrowth topics for many people, when afterall we do require a good imagination to see beyond a growth-obsessed world! </p>  <p> Book 7 - Ecotopía: The Notebooks and Reports of William Weston  <br>   <br>Author : Ernest Callenbach Comments on this book:  While definitely feeling dated now, Ecotopia stands out among the literature of its time for its ability to envision and portray what a society based around environmentalist ideals could look like. The protagonist's journey, from being a sarcastic American journalist to becoming a full-blown Ecotopian critical of its past, is worth a read. </p>  <p>Ecotopia book cover <br>Ecotopia listing on Wikipedia <br> Book 8 - Pacific Edge  <br>   <br>Author : </p>  <p>Kim Stanley Robinson</p>  <p> Comments on this book:  </p>  <p>Pacific Edge is a "slice of life" novel, the time of a summer, where we are faced with the questions of economic capture of democratic processes in an alternative eco-friendly California. As often, personal and political rivalries are intertwined, but the book offers an idea of how community involvement can yield sometimes unforeseen results.</p>  <p>Pacific Edge book cover <br>Kim Stanley Robinson info site <br> Book 9 - Sunvault: Stories of Solarpunk and Eco-Speculation  <br>   <br>Authors : A.C. Wise, Kristine Ong Muslim, Daniel José Older, Nisi Shawl, Iona Sharma, Jaymee Goh, Lavie Tidhar Comments on this book:  This is a collection of short-stories. They're not all utopian, but it feels good to have stories that are trying to center themselves around ideals of solidarity and environmental preservation while not shying away from the real difficulties this may yield. Everyone should find at least one that resonates with them.   </p>  <p>Sunvault book cover <br>Boston Hearth Project by TJ Watson <br> Book 10 - A Psalm for the Wild-Built  <br>   <br>Author : Becky Chambers Comments on this book:  This is a breath of fresh air, a piece of meditative literature giving off post-apocalyptic chill vibes. Where did the robots go? is its narrative central question, and the protagonist's journey will lead them to get some answers. Insistence on low-tech and slowing things down definitely resonate with Degrowth imaginaries.</p>  <p>A Psalm for the Wild-Built <br>A Psalm for the Wild-Built on Wikipedia <br>   <br>Books above recommended by </p>  <p> Félix Garnier , a founding member of the IDN and coordinator of the Europe Circle, now on the Board as a legal representative.</p>  <p>Félix Garnier <br>Félix Garnier <br> Interested in Degrowth? Why not join as a volunteer...  <br>   <br>The IDN is made up of a group of volunteers around the world, collectively working together to try and bring the degrowth movement together whilst helping to support those who are interested in building a post-growth society. It is completely free to join us as a volunteer and to actively participate within our movement. If interested, you can find out more and apply to  join us here .</p>

        <p><b>Author</b>: Jason Hickel<br><b>Comments on this book:</b> I really, really, really liked "Less is More" by Jason Hickel. I learned a lot about the history of capitalism, commons, enclosure/privatization, religion and more.</p><p><i>(Matt's addition: I too liked this book a lot. I would describe it as being my "gateway drug to the world of Degrowth" - it is a nice, fairly gentle introduction to the topic).</i></p>

        <p>One of our members (Félix Garnier) wanted to recommend some Degrowth fiction books - and who are we to deny him this opportunity? So, here is not one but four (!) recommended fiction books.</p><p><br><i>Sidenote that reading fiction can be a more appealing form of being introduced to the topic of degrowth and postgrowth topics for many people, when afterall we do require a good imagination to see beyond a growth-obsessed world! </i></p>

        <p><b>Author</b>: Ernest Callenbach<br><b>Comments on this book:</b> While definitely feeling dated now, Ecotopia stands out among the literature of its time for its ability to envision and portray what a society based around environmentalist ideals could look like. The protagonist's journey, from being a sarcastic American journalist to becoming a full-blown Ecotopian critical of its past, is worth a read. </p>

        <p><b>Author</b>:   Kim Stanley Robinson  <br><b>Comments on this book:</b>   Pacific Edge is a "slice of life" novel, the time of a summer, where we are faced with the questions of economic capture of democratic processes in an alternative eco-friendly California. As often, personal and political rivalries are intertwined, but the book offers an idea of how community involvement can yield sometimes unforeseen results.  </p>

        <p><b>Authors</b>: A.C. Wise, Kristine Ong Muslim, Daniel José Older, Nisi Shawl, Iona Sharma, Jaymee Goh, Lavie Tidhar<br><b>Comments on this book:</b> This is a collection of short-stories. They're not all utopian, but it feels good to have stories that are trying to center themselves around ideals of solidarity and environmental preservation while not shying away from the real difficulties this may yield. Everyone should find at least one that resonates with them.   </p>

        <p><b>Author</b>: Becky Chambers<br><b>Comments on this book:</b> This is a breath of fresh air, a piece of meditative literature giving off post-apocalyptic chill vibes. Where did the robots go? is its narrative central question, and the protagonist's journey will lead them to get some answers. Insistence on low-tech and slowing things down definitely resonate with Degrowth imaginaries.</p>
