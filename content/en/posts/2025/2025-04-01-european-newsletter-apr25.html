    <p>European Circle update  <br>   <br>During our last Circle meeting (see also the minutes) we fixed the date and topic for our first webinar: if you are interested in Rights of nature and how this relates to degrowth, mark the evening of April 29th in your calendar (exact time will follow)! As usual, we also shared updates on what's cooking in the different degrowth groups in Europe.We are also very pleased to welcome our latest organization that joined the IDN from Berlin: Growing Out of Growth (GOOG) (https://growingoutofgrowth.org/). They are responsible for example of the very successful Degrowthuary campaign last February. Check out their Instagram for more information.</p>  <p> Calls for help!  <br>   <br>No calls for help this month!If you would like input for a project, have a job opportunity to share or anything else you need help with from our degrowth community, let us know at europe@degrowth.net!</p>  <p> Upcoming events/actions  <br>   <br>Brussels [Belgium], every other week, starting March 29thEvery other Saturday, starting March 29, Growth Kills and Scientist Rebellion will reclaim public space by forming circles of chairs to discuss concrete solutions to the social and ecological crises. Our goal: to promote participatory democracy by creating sovereign citizens' assemblies.Since the state prohibits unauthorized demonstrations, setting up a circle of chairs in a public space is technically forbidden. But this very restriction gives the action the necessary dose of sensationalism to draw media attention. More importantly, it forces the public to reflect: <br>What kind of "democracy" do we live in if citizens who simply place chairs in public space to debate are systematically removed by the police? <br>And what legitimacy do politicians-especially those on the far right-have to claim they represent our voices? <br>Online, April 22nd and 24thIn view of the 6th International Assembly of the Degrowth Movement, online assemblies will take place in April 2025. Register here (mandatory for participation).Online and in-person seminars Utrecht university [The Netherlands] starting on 24th AprilWelcome to Visions for the Futurehttps://visions-for-the-future.sites.uu.nl/A range of alternative socio-economic systems have been proposed as solutions to the pressing challenges of our age such as deepening ecological crises, growing material and social inequalities, and pervasive corporate power, just to name a few. Yet so far there has not been a comprehensive ethical analysis that allows one to rigorously compare these proposals, which makes it difficult for scholars, citizens, and politicians to know which alternative system (or combination of such systems) is most promising. The new Visions for the Future will conduct this analysis by critically exploring the institutional makeup of these systems and their ability to realise the range of normative values that are at stake.JUNE[Everywhere] Global Degrowth Day 2025, June 7thThis year we are resuming the tradition of celebrating Global Degrowth Day on the first Saturday in June, which falls on June 7, 2025.Please use the form below to register your event and contribute to a world map of degrowth celebrations demonstrating the liveliness of the movement. https://my.liberaforms.org/registration-gdd-2025Oslo [Norway], June 23-27th <br>June 23rd - Beyond Growth conference at the University of Oslo (Ole Johan Dahls Hus) Kate Raworth delivers keynote, event mostly in Norwegian) <br>June 23rd - 6th International Assembly of the Degrowth Movement (in-person) <br>June 24-27th - The conference ISEE-Degrowth 2025 is jointly organised as the 18th Conference of the International Society for Ecological Economics (ISEE) and the 11th International Degrowth Conference.</p>  <p>JULYBarcelona [Spain], July 3-6thStrategy conference on degrowth of aviation and tourismThe conference will happen in Barcelona between 3rd-6th July 2025 (tbc) with the potential for hubs in other places of the world as well as with hybrid formats to attend online.
