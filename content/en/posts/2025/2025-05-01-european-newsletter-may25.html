    <p>European Circle update  <br>   <br>During our last Circle meeting (see also the  minutes ) we fixed the date and topic for our first webinar: if you are interested in  Rights of nature  and how this relates to degrowth, mark the evening of April 29th in your calendar (exact time will follow)! As usual, we also shared updates on what's cooking in the different degrowth groups in Europe. We are also very pleased to welcome our latest organization that joined the IDN from Berlin:  Growing Out of Growth (GOOG)  ( https://growingoutofgrowth.org/ ). They are responsible for example of the very successful  Degrowthuary  campaign last February.  Check out their  Instagram  for more information.</p>  <p> Calls for help!  <br>   <br>Documentary 'running on candles' released Intermedia Producciones has recently released their new documentary  Running on candles . The docu shows how, in 2022, residents from working-class neighbourhoods in Sevilla rose up against electricity company Endesa for imposing indiscriminate power cuts, while accusing the residents of stealing electricity. In this way, Endesa tried to cover up its lack of investment by criminalising working-class neighbourhoods. The documentary exposes this dynamic of power cuts as being global and classist, with examples of people fighting for the right to electricity in the Sierra de Cádiz, in Kurdistan, California, Senegal and Puerto Rico. It also gives valuable reflections on how the devastating implementation of large-scale renewables is related to the depletion of fossil fuels. Check out the trailer  here ! Materials or experience with education and degrowth The Belgian  More than enough  network has recently gathered again after a more quiet period and a working group on degrowth in education has formed! Several projects are ongoing in different contexts (Erasmus+ for a broad range of ages, entering degrowth in technical bachelor and master programmes...), but the group feels like all input is welcome. If you have experience with bringing a degrowth perspective into an educational context (in particular where it's usually not mentioned), or know of any interesting sources, they'd be happy to get in touch. You can reach them through the  contact form  on their website.</p>  <p> Upcoming events/actions  <br>   <br>MAY Vienna [Austria], May 2nd On May 2nd (so  tomorrow !), Degrowth Vienna is organising a workshop titled:  Degrowth: A solution to climate crisis and inequality?  You can find more info  here !
