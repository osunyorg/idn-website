        <p><strong>Support Degrowthuary! [Europe]</strong></p><p>GOOG Berlin is a group of people committed to helping bring about socio-ecological transformation by advocating for degrowth ideas, values, and policies.

Under the theme of “Transformation in Action!”, the Agroecology Europe Forum 2025 will spotlight collaboration, integration and bold action to accelerate agroecological transitions across Europe. We are bringing together diverse stakeholders to energise, strengthen and expand the European agroecology movement. Share knowledge and experience, gain inspiration, showcase success stories and tackle challenges in a visionary space filled with innovative ideas and actionable solutions. For the first time, the 5th Agroecology Europe Forum is hosted in the Nordics, transforming into a vibrant festival welcoming both food system changemakers and the public. We want everyone to have a taste of the transformation that agroecology offers!</p><p>We now welcome food system actors from all sectors with or without explicit linkage to - or previous knowledge of - agroecology to co-create the programme for Agroecology Europe Forum 2025. Are you a farmer, advocate, student, policymaker, researcher, chef, distributor, advisor, retailer, food producer or food-enthusiast in another way? Do you work in alignment with the principles of agroecology? Do you have a wish to contribute?
