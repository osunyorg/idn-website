All positions are for 4 years and to be undertaken on site, in the beautiful city of Cáceres, Spain (with 2 work-from-home days/week). The image below provides more information about the application itself (deadline, where to find the position, etc.).<br>Robert’s hope is to set up a team of bright minds for this project that contributes at its own scale to the Degrowth movement. He can be reached at <a href="mailto:romain.mauger@ciiae.org" target="_blank">romain.mauger@ciiae.org <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a></p><p><img></p><ul><li><strong>Call for degrowther graphic artists!</strong></li></ul><p>Do you have some experience as an artist in comic creation?
