    Communicating Degrowth - a personal blog from IDN volunteer Kanika Prajapat
  summary: >-
    <p>The below is a guest post from IDN volunteer Kanika Prajapat, sharing her thoughts on Degrowth communication, a Degrowth themed card game, and learnings from recent Degrowth workshops she's hosted.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>"The degrowth community is very good at communicating what degrowth is NOT. However, a clear definition or simple description of what degrowth is, cannot be provided by most people in the degrowth community. This illustrates the complexity of explaining it in layman's terms. You want to give a convincing elevator pitch, not bore them for 15 min and have them walk away with a 'sure, that'll never happen' - feeling" Such a brutally honest comment we received from a participant in a survey I conducted about communicating Degrowth. Many others shared their struggle with articulating the ever-evolving concept of degrowth, specifically when it comes to making it relevant and actionable for the majority of the audience.¬†¬† ¬† Here are the other key challenges we identified from the survey -  <br> Degrowth ideas being too complex to explain in a short time  <br> People not being able to make the topic¬† relevant ¬†to their audience  <br> Concepts being non-actionable and inconcrete  <br> Facing dismissal like "it's impractical", or "it is what it is"  <br> The word "Degrowth" is not very helpful to start with  <br> Overcoming these objectives will be important if we want to reach a wider, perhaps more mainstream audience in a meaningful way. </p>  <p> New Normal - A Degrowth-Themed Card Game  <br>   <br>Along with another Master's Student, Fanny, I have been working on creating a card game called the New Normal, which aims to make it easier for people to engage with and communicate degrowth-aligned ideas better. After working on it on and off for about a year and half, we finally hosted our first prototype testing in the real world with real people at  DeSchool , Chicago, and gathered a lot of constructive and critical feedback on which we are iterating right now. The game is built upon the  Theory of Common Sense by Antonio Gramsci , which says that in our society, there are a certain set of beliefs and ideologies that people hold about the "natural order of things," which is often shaped by the dominant culture to maintain the status quo. The game aims to challenge these prevalent capitalist-imperialist common senses and replace them with more eco-socialist values instead, by incorporating effective and strategic narrative tools.¬†¬† It is still a work in progress, and there's a lot that needs to be done before it can be moved to production, but we are very happy to achieve the first important milestone of prototype testing.</p>  <p>Degrowth card game <br>Kanika Prajapat on Substack <br> Speaking at Degrowth Workshops - and Lessons Learned!  <br>   <br>Ever since I finished my master's, one of my key goals has been to be able to speak about Degrowth in a room full of people and face their curiosities and questions with conviction and confidence. In the last few months, I hosted 2 in-person (Thanks to  The Climate Party ) and few online sessions dedicated to exploring Degrowth ideas, with an audience ranging from people who have never heard of this concept to people working in the policy-making space, from students to lawyers, from start-up founders to social workers, and woah, what a thrilling experience it has been!¬†¬† I'm very fortunate to have received these opportunities, and for everything that I learnt in a relatively short amount of time. Here are a few key lessons from all these workshops...</p>  <p>Kanika Prajapat speaking at a conference <br>Kanika Prajapat on Substack <br> Lesson 1 - Degrowth is in Demand!  <br>   <br>The most important thing I learnt is that there is an appetite for such conversations in India. My biggest fear before these sessions was what if nobody cares about it here in India? What if they think it's a completely unnecessary and irrelevant concept for us Global South folks here! ¬†But I realised that most people are just so fed up with the current socio-economic-political structure, the cracks in the system are very clearly visible to most now and people are hungry for fresh perspectives and new narratives. My audience not only¬† resonated ¬†with everything I presented, but they also built on it, shared their experiences, and validated my belief that there is space for such discussions here.¬†¬†</p>  <p>Crowd at the Degrowth event in India <br>Kanika Prajapat on Substack <br> Lesson 2 - There's a Growing Community in Hyderabad (and elsewhere!)  <br>   <br>¬†Second, the workshops expanded my network of people interested in exploring degrowth ideas within India. The Masters has given me a wonderful set of friends and collaborators from across the world, who keep me sane, grounded, and in high spirits. But as I am based out of India, I think it is vital to have a community of people operating within a similar context so we can organise more meaningful and impactful actions. With another friend, Ira, we are thinking of starting a community based in Hyderabad, which can come together to discuss, brainstorm, and strategize for a better economy and society. If you are based out of Hyderabad, please reach out, we'd love to know more about what you are up to and how we can support each other's work.¬†¬†</p>  <p>Kanika's degrowth support network on a group call <br>Kanika Prajapat on Substack <br> Lesson 3 - Finding Order in Chaos  <br>   <br>Third, because of the workshops, I had to take a bird's eye view of the entire degrowth literature and come up with a neat, coherent narrative that flows and makes sense. Here's where things get really interesting because I'm going to use the same narrative structure to organise  my Substack publication  in the coming months. As someone who is constantly trying to find order in chaos, here's how I would organise the massively complex web of degrowth ideas -  <br>  <br> Why? ¬†- Degrowth, first and foremost, is a critique of the destructive nature of capitalism, its relentless pursuit of growth, and the resulting multi-dimensional polycrisis.  <br> Origin of Growth Paradigm  <br> Infinite Exponential Growth  <br> Growth at all costs  <br> Growing the wrong things  <br> Unequal and colonial growth  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> What? ¬†- If not this, then what? Well, Degrowth envisions a future rooted in well-being, sustainability, justice, and democracy. It draws inspiration from diverse sources, including Southern alternatives and existing examples of degrowth in various sectors.  <br> Origin of Degrowth ideas  <br> Theoretical Foundations of Degrowth  <br> Different Approaches to Degrowth - Biophysical, Systemic, Cultural  <br> Criticisms and misconceptions of degrowth  <br> Grassroots Alternatives to Growth  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> How? ¬†- Lastly, Degrowth is a growing movement driving this transformation through activism, community-led initiatives, and policy interventions.  <br> Policies for Degrowth  <br> Putting Degrowth into Practice  <br> Communicating Degrowth ideas effectively  <br>  <br> </p>  <p>Organising Degrowth - How, What and Why <br>Kanika Prajapat on Substack <br> Reigniting Hope thanks to Degrowth  <br>   <br>Of course, one can talk about all the wonderful principles, policies, and examples without ever using the word "Degrowth", but for now I'm going to give it the due credit for opening my eyes, and for acknowledging and channelling the anger and frustration I feel with the way things are right now. Most of us are aware of and deeply affected by the extent of injustice and violence the current system is inflicting on the world (prayers for Palestine), and I wouldn't want to do anything less than ruthlessly attacking it, which is precisely what the word "Degrowth" does. After enduring years of hopelessness and helplessness in the climate movement, I found my hope back in Degrowth, and I wish my work instils some of that in you, too.¬†¬†</p>  <p> Guest Post </p>  <p>This was a guest post written by IDN volunteer Kanika Prajapat based in India üíö We encourage existing IDN volunteers to make use of our website to share their thoughts and experiences in the degrowth space üêå If you would like to learn more about volunteering with the IDN to help encourage a transition to a degrowth orientated world, you can find out more  info here .</p>  <p>Project & Product Management Specialist</p>

After enduring years of hopelessness and helplessness in the climate movement, I found my hope back in Degrowth, and I wish my work instils some of that in you, too.¬†¬†</p>
