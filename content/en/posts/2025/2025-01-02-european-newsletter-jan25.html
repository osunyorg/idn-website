        <p>During the <em>morning session</em>, the first Future Generations Commissioner for Wales, Sophie Howe (2016 – 2023) reported on the rationale of the <a href="https://letters.degrowth.net/c/https%253A%252F%252Fwww.futuregenerations.wales%252F/nmr_ar2kRXV4/ntl_xogqP2V2/f2Olluj-apy7KZgs8b8SDVxh2CxfxV966bXNgzht7lc" target="_blank">Well-being of Future Generations Act <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a>, its implementation, difficulties and successes.<br>It was followed by Susana Fonseca, Vice-President of ZERO, who outlined the project of a future Portuguese law to protect the interests of Future Generations.<br>Filipe Martins, director of the Jesuit European Social Center and campaigner for the <a href="https://letters.degrowth.net/c/https%253A%252F%252Ffitforfuturegenerations.eu%252F/nmr_ar2kRXV4/ntl_ERgvZvgp/1nCMmDEChYbLO6FuA7kzd3JCL280r6Bs-0VtxMSgRtM" target="_blank">Future Generations Initiative <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a> on the European level, gave an update on their lobbying for an Inter-institutional Declaration on the Rights of Future Generations, the nomination of a European Future Generations Commissioner and a Better Regulation Guidelines to include intergenerational justice as a key principle for any law-making.</p><p>A roundtable with politicians and members of parliament, moderated by João José Fernandes, President of OIKOS, discussed current political initiatives that are still focused on the short-term and particular issues and political struggles between parties. These discussions always feel insufficient for the degrowth movement.</p>

        <p><em>After the lunch break</em>, Morena Hanbury Lemos, doctoral researcher in Ecological Economics at the Autonomous University of Barcelona and part of the REAL project led by Julia Steinberger, Jason Hickel and Giorgos Kallis, gave a lecture on how colonial patterns are reproduced in today’s global economy and set the stage for the discussion about possible futures Beyond Growth that must include global justice.</p>

        <p>The following panel discussion was moderated by Hans Eickhoff, member of the Portuguese Degrowth Network and doctoral researcher in Human Ecology at the Interdisciplinary Centre of Social Sciences (CICS.NOVA), Faculty of Social Sciences and Humanities (NOVA FCSH), and focused on the problematic of the growth paradigm, the imaginary of possible futures, and possible obstacles on the way to get there.</p><p>Carlos Antunes, Professor in Geospatial Engineering at the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon (FCUL), specialized in Geodesy, Hydrography and Sea Level Variation, underscored that the current crisis must not be understood only as a climate, environmental and biodiversity crisis, but also as crisis of the paradigm of the global social and economic model that is very much based on excessive energy dependence and unsustainable consumption. Thus, the transition to a cheap, available and green model of resources and energy use becomes difficult because the annual rates of change and the global environmental footprint are incompatible with the targets required in a short period. Patrícia Melo, Professor at the Department of Economics at ISEG (Lisbon School of Economics and Management), University of Lisbon and researcher in the ISEG Research in Economics and Management R&amp;D unit, confessed her sense of responsibility towards the generations of Economics and Management students that are future policy-makers and managers, trying to make the curriculum more plural and critical of the models for organizing the economy and its relationship with the social-ecological systems in which it operates.</p><p>Paula Cardoso, graduated in International Relations, journalist, and founder of the digital community Afrolink, advocated that, in response to the impossible present we are living in, overwhelmed by economic and financial indicators and drained of humanity, futures beyond growth are the only possible future where people’s lives are worth more than corporate profits.</p>

        <p>Finally, Jorge Pinto, member of the left ecological LIVRE party and graduated in Environmental Engineering with a PhD in Social and Political Philosophy, returned to the initial question considering that futures - be they the people who are yet to be born or the different futures we can create - are constantly being born which means that being born implies growing up, but this leads to questions: how do we grow, how much, when?</p><p>The panel discussion generated a lively Q&amp;A session that was continued with food and drinks in the lounge after the closing lecture by Inês Cosme. Inês graduated in Environmental Engineering with a PhD in Globalization Studies and works as Assistant Professor at Faculty of Social Sciences and Humanities (NOVA FCSH) and consultant on corporate sustainability strategies. In her talk, Inês explored principles and policy proposals for a future beyond growth that will require changing our mental models and should be based on reduced consumption and advertising, a localized cooperative and community-orientated economy at the service of Nature, a universal basic income, and the achievement of wellbeing instead of growth.</p>
