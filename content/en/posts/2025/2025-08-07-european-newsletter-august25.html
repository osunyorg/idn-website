    <p>European Circle update  <br>   <br>Our last circle meeting was a relaxed one, where we shared some reflections on the Oslo conference. If interested in more detail you can read the  Outcomes  from the  Assembly of the Degrowth movement  or check the  Recordings  of the  ISEE-Degrowth conference. We continued taking small steps in the organisation of our webinar series coming in Autumn. Remember the preliminary dates and topics (to be confirmed with partners and speakers):  <br> Thursday September 18th: Rights of nature  <br> Wednesday October 14th: Degrowth policies  <br> Monday November 10th: The imperial mode of living  <br> Friday December 5th: Collapse awareness  <br> If this sounds interesting, keep your eyes and ears open for future updates! We are also still looking to select new role-holders (coordinator, representative, secretary), so do feel warmly invited to our next Circle meeting on Wednesday August 13th, 4:30 - 5:30 PM CEST,  here . The minutes of the past European Circle meetings can still be found  here .  </p>  <p> 👋 New IDN members  <br>   <br>SERI - Sustainable Europe Research Institute Deutschland e.V.
