    <p>What's your location?  <br>I'm Spanish and living in Düsseldorf, Germany.</p>  <p> Why do you think degrowth is, or should be, the future?  <br>On the specific topic of achieving carbon neutrality, I see Degrowth as a crucial pillar.Transitioning from fossil fuels to green energy alone just shifts the problem, like dealing with excess batteries or where to put so many renewables. We would also need to reduce unnecessary consumption, such as luxury products and industries that don’t benefit society, like the war industry.On a broader scale, Degrowth offers an opportunity to rethink our economic and social systems, address the imbalance between the Global North and South, and protect the most vulnerable to the growing power of a few.  </p>  <p> Are you part of a member org? Which IDN circles are you in?  <br>Yes, I am part of a Spanish one called Red Decrecer para Vivir https://degrowth.net/organisations/red-decrecer-para-vivir/</p>  <p>For the past year, I have been very active in IDN. Currently as Coordinator of the practice circle, Secretary of organizing and general circles, by welcoming new members and helping with European newsletter, mainly.</p>  <p> What degrowth things are you working on?  <br>As well as my work with the IDN and the Spanish group, I am involved in the organization of the next Beyond Growth conference in the Spanish parliament planned for Friday 26th September 2025.</p>  <p>Also, locally there is a Post-Growth group being created in Cologne which I like very much since we meet in person. This counterbalances all the online events and meetings from the rest of initiatives.</p>  <p> What support do you need from other members - how can we help?  <br>Well, support and hands are needed everywhere. I would say anyone with a degrowth idea can come and implement it with the help of others here at the IDN. We need people with the self-drive to make their initiative a reality.</p>  <p>   <br>Juan Jose can be contacted via Matrix, the platform used to connect members of the IDN, at @juanjoss4, or via LinkedIn. </p>
