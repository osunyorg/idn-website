    <p>What is your location?  <br>Munich, Germany</p>  <p> Why do you think degrowth is, or should be, the future?  <br>For me, the idea of endless growth on a planet with finite resources just doesn’t make sense. Despite all the material wealth we’ve accumulated, we’re seeing more social inequality and environmental damage than ever. I believe we need to shift away from measuring success through GDP and start focusing on well-being indicators that actually matter - things like ecological health, social equity, and community resilience. Degrowth isn’t about going backward; it’s about creating systems that help both people and the planet thrive.</p>  <p> Are you part of a member org? Which IDN circles are you in?  <br>I’m the founder of Omagua, a grassroots association based in Munich, Germany, and we joined IDN because we believe strongly in the power of collective action. Currently, we’re exploring the Research and Transformational Education circles, but we’re always open to collaborating in other areas that align with our mission and values.</p>  <p> What degrowth things are you working on?  <br>At Omagua, we’re really focused on education because we believe it’s key to creating real change. We’re working on launching a free online certificate program to help people understand the systems that are harming our planet and give them the tools to take action. It’s all about shifting mindsets and promoting regenerative practices that align with degrowth principles. On top of that, I’m also a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Munich, and my thesis is all about degrowth in a U.S. context.</p>  <p> What support do you need from other members - how can we help?  <br>I’m always eager to connect with like-minded people and exchange ideas. Collaboration is really important to me, and I believe that’s how we’ll make real change happen. I’m open to hosting remote volunteers, forming strategic partnerships, and working together on new projects. If you’ve got ideas or want to collaborate, I’d love to hear from you!</p>  <p>   <br>Miklas can be contacted via Matrix, the platform used to connect members of the IDN, at @miklassauermann or through the contact page at  omagua.org</p>
