    <p>Highlights during previous month Nov'24  <br>   <br>Brussels (BE), every Friday and Saturday since the <br>beginning of October <br>In October and throughout a part of November, the Belgian Growth <br>Kills, together with Scientist Rebellion, organised their Degrowth on <br>Tour outreach activities, which consisted of engaging in <br>conversations with people passing by on a large shopping street (Rue Neuve). <br>The self-imposed challenge was to spark a people’s assembly, metamorphosing a <br>growth street spirit into a degrowth one! With the help of Scientist Rebellion <br>(see their Instagram), the Degrowth on Tour <br>initiative spread to several other countries.Brussels (BE), November 29th <br>Next up for the Growth Kills team was a Black Friday action that went <br>beautifully, with a bunch of news outlets covering it. Some examples: <br> The Canary <br>  <br>LeSoir (French)  <br>  <br>L’avenir (French)  <br>  <br>Rtl (short video in French)  <br>  <br>Rtl (longer video in French)  <br>  <br>Rtl (French)  <br>  <br>Rtbf (French)  <br>  <br>DeWereldMorgen (Dutch)  <br>  <br>HLN (Dutch, commercial news)  <br>  <br>Bruzz (Dutch, Brussels news)  <br>Copenhagen (DK), November 29th <br>Degrowth Copenhagen too did an action on Black Friday: on the occasion of the <br>Black Friday/Week, we, Degrowth Copenhagen, organized the Fuck Black Friday <br>Action in Radhuspladsen, Copenhagen’s main square, to create awareness about <br>the impacts of consumerism. We set up a free clothing shop <br>by hanging discarded clothes on a long wire tied to two lamp posts, free for <br>everyone to take. Playing bangers on a soundbox helped us to catch people’s <br>attention while handing out flyers with the message “Are you a consumer or <br>being consumed?”. We engaged in talks with people, handed out stickers with our <br>logos and our Manifesto to the most curious. We read speeches and poems about <br>facts on overconsumption, the socio-ecological impact of advertisement as well <br>as degrowth solutions. Some of us staged a catwalk wearing self-styled outfits <br>made of discarded clothes and bags. As International Solidarity <br>Day, we read a list of (consumer goods) companies that profit from the Genocide <br>and Apartheid System in Palestine via the Watermelon Index, while inviting the <br>people passing by to Boycott, Divest and Sanction. Later we joined the protest <br>in front of Humac - an Apple products reseller - by other fellow activists in <br>Solidarity with the people in the Congo - where western corporations like <br>Apple, Dell, Google, Microsoft, and Tesla encouraged Cobalt’s mining companies <br>to exploit children for labor, forcing them to work in hazardous conditions <br>that resulted in fatalities and serious injuries. There were multiple <br>initiatives in the city to counter Black Friday, including repair workshops and <br>swaps. <br>   <br> </p>  <p>We found talking to the <br>heterogenous group of street passengers an educational and challenging <br>experience: each person has a totally different level of understanding and <br>awareness of the climate crisis and the need for system change. If Degrowth <br>aims to become a mass movement, we need to sharpen our arguments and ability to <br>engage people from all backgrounds. </p>  <p>   <br>Bonn (DE), 6ᵗʰ-7ᵗʰ November <br>Development Beyond Growth – Global and Local Perspectives <br>on Just Transitions Organised by the Next Economy Lab <br>  <br>   <br>  Ever more, ever higher, ever <br>further? This question formed the core theme of the “Development Beyond Growth <br>- Global and Local Perspectives on Just Transitions” conference, held on <br>November 6 and 7, 2024, in Bonn. The event was organized by NELA. Next Economy Lab, and the German Institute of Development and Sustainability (IDOS). <br>More than 100 participants from both the Global South and North came together <br>to explore how societies can shape sustainable futures beyond the traditional <br>growth paradigm.The conference, held in a fully <br>hybrid format, featured numerous panels, presentations, and workshops. In her <br>keynote address, Miriam Lang, professor at the Department of Environment and <br>Sustainability at the University Andina Simón Bolívar in Ecuador, addressed <br>issues of green colonialism and global justice. Additionally, a panel delved <br>into the concepts of degrowth, green growth, and a-growth, discussing their <br>potential to foster ecological resilience and social equity. Céline Keller <br>introduced her graphic novel Who Is Afraid of Degrowth? which <br>challenges common misunderstandings of degrowth principles. She also shared <br>insights into the creative process behind the book, which makes the complex <br>ideas of the postgrowth movement accessible to a wide audience.</p>  <p>Several workshops explored <br>subjects such as the growth dependence of current economic systems, the donut <br>economy model, the role of inequality and redistribution, and just transitions <br>toward a sustainable economy. The conference concluded with a public event <br>that, like the entire conference, bridged scientific research with practical <br>experience. Recordings of parts of the event are available on YouTube.</p>  <p>   <br>Barcelona (ES), 21ˢᵗ November <br>Norrsken BarcelonaThis free event saw max <br>capacity, with 100 people in attendance.Mike Duff is heavily involved <br>with Degrowth/post growth policies being enacted by the left wing CUP <br>administration in Girona and gave some excellent insight about ongoing <br>strategies, such as how they are getting Degrowth literature into school <br>libraries and encouraging degrowth-aligned businesses such as repair shops.Álvaro Álvarez showed a short <br>version of his Degrowth doc that aired on the BBC. He talked about how there <br>are people at the BBC sympathetic to the Degrowth movement, who are hungry for <br>more degrowth stories/content.Daragh Cogley gave reference to <br>how degrowth and bio economy movements must fight the genocide occurring in <br>Gaza, Lebanon and the West Bank. He also told of how he and other EU economy <br>youth ambassadors have helped push the European Commission to re-engage with <br>true bio economy tenets: https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/news/all-research-and-innovation-news/meet-our-bioeconomy-youth-ambassadors-2022-08-04_enLisbon (PT), October 26th <br>Lançamento da revista Gerador 44 - Decrescer para evitar o colapso (Launch of <br>Gerador Magazine nº 44 - Degrowth to avoid collapse; https://www.goethe.de/ins/pt/pt/ver.cfm?event_id=26131093, <br>https://gerador.eu/revista/)Lisbon (PT), November 16th <br>8º Encontro de 2024 do Núcleo de Lisboa | Transição energética: Separar a <br>realidade da ilusão (8th Lisbon Local Group Meeting 2024 | Energy transition: <br>Separating reality from illusion; https://www.decrescimento.pt/events/8o-encontro-de-2024-do-nucleo-de-lisboa/).Pisa (IT), 22nd-24th November  <br>Le vie della decrescita: Giornate di riflessione e <br>dialogo sul litorale toscano</p>  <p>Athens (GR), 29th November - 2nd December <br>Roots Winter School 2024 | Strategies for <br>socio-ecological transformations in times of uncertainty</p>  <p> Upcoming events  <br>   <br>Lisbon (PT), December 16th, 10:00-17:15  <br>Taking <br>Care of Future Generations - Acting Now: Exploring Possible Futures Beyond <br>Growth Location: (following in a later <br>announcement)The Portuguese Degrowth Network <br>(Rede para o Decrescimento), together with ZERO - Associação Sistema Terrestre <br>Sustentável (Association for a Sustainable Earth System) as partner of the <br>Wellbeing Economy Alliance (WEAll), and Oikos - Cooperação e Desenvolvimento <br>(Cooperation and Development) is organizing the “Beyond Growth” event “Pensar <br>nas Gerações Futuras – Agir no Presente: Explorar Futuros Possíveis para além <br>do Crescimento” (Taking Care of Future Generations - Acting Now: Exploring <br>Possible Futures Beyond Growth).

(Dutch, Brussels news) </li> </ul><p><strong>Copenhagen (DK), November 29th</strong><br> Degrowth Copenhagen too did an action on Black Friday: on the occasion of the Black Friday/Week, we, Degrowth Copenhagen, organized the Fuck Black Friday Action in Radhuspladsen, Copenhagen’s main square, to create awareness about the impacts of consumerism. </p><p>We set up a free clothing shop by hanging discarded clothes on a long wire tied to two lamp posts, free for everyone to take. Playing bangers on a soundbox helped us to catch people’s attention while handing out flyers with the message “Are you a consumer or being consumed?”. We engaged in talks with people, handed out stickers with our logos and our Manifesto to the most curious. We read speeches and poems about facts on overconsumption, the socio-ecological impact of advertisement as well as degrowth solutions. Some of us staged a catwalk wearing self-styled outfits made of discarded clothes and bags. </p><p>As International Solidarity Day, we read a list of (consumer goods) companies that profit from the Genocide and Apartheid System in Palestine via the Watermelon Index, while inviting the people passing by to Boycott, Divest and Sanction. Later we joined the protest in front of Humac - an Apple products reseller - by other fellow activists in Solidarity with the people in the Congo - where western corporations like Apple, Dell, Google, Microsoft, and Tesla encouraged Cobalt’s mining companies to exploit children for labor, forcing them to work in hazardous conditions that resulted in fatalities and serious injuries. There were multiple initiatives in the city to counter Black Friday, including repair workshops and swaps.<img></p><p>      </p><p>                  </p><p>We found talking to the heterogenous group of street passengers an educational and challenging experience: each person has a totally different level of understanding and awareness of the climate crisis and the need for system change. If Degrowth aims to become a mass movement, we need to sharpen our arguments and ability to engage people from all backgrounds. </p>

Further information will follow soon.</p><p><strong>Brussels (BE), December 12th, 17:00-18:00</strong><br> <em>Launch of Critical Minerals Observatory</em></p><p>Location: Hotel de Colonies, Rue des Croisades 6-10, Brussels, 1210 Belgium</p><p>The Critical Minerals Observatory is a new initiative from the European Network of Corporate Observatory (ENCO); a knowledge hub (critical space) to exchange ideas, resources and develop collaborative research. This Observatory looks at the strategies of transnational corporations and governments (in the Global North) to secure supplies of critical minerals in the name of the energy transition.</p><p>The launch of the Observatory will take place during the Raw Materials Week, to expose the necessity to monitor the implementation of the CRMA and its impacts on communities and the environment. During the presentation, we will discuss how we can use available public data to understand better who the main players are on on the global supply chains and hear about the corporate impunity mining companies, with voices of affected communities in Madagascar and Serbia.
