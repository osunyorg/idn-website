Sessions can  have different formats, as described in some detail below. Each session will have a <b>chair</b> who is responsible for the session.</p><p> <b>Parallel sessions</b> will  be held during the same time slot of <b>1.5 hours (90 minutes). Special Sessions</b> will be carried out during the parallel session slots.</p><p> Any person can submit a proposal for organizing a <b>Special Session</b>.  The Special Sessions aim to give space for content with a  unique topic and format, and/or groups of people who want to present  the progress or results of a specific project or creative contribution.  These sessions can align with any of the <a href="https://isee-degrowth2025.no/programme1/thematic-tracks" target="_blank"><b>10  predefined thematic tracks and sub-themes</b><span class="sr-only"> - external link</span></a>, or they may also bring in new themes – as long as they align with  the conference's overall main theme: <b><i>Building socially just postgrowth futures – linking theory and action.</i></b></p><p> A Special Session can be either “open” or “closed”:</p><ul> <li> <b>Open Special Sessions </b>are  sessions of which the general  framing is defined by the session proposer and organizer. These  sessions will be open to the participation of any applicant during the  “call for abstracts” period that opens by early December.</li> <li> <b>Closed Special Sessions </b>are  organized within the  context of a specific project that aligns with the overall theme of the  conference. Presenting in a closed session is by invitation only, as  presenters are determined by the session proposers and organizers.</li> </ul><p> All  applicants proposing an Open Special Session or a Closed Special  Session must indicate whether their proposed session fit within  either the "Conventional" format or the “Free format".</p><ul> <li> A <b>conventional</b> session  is a classical, academic panel session, in which 3-4 presenters share  from their analytical work, and receive feedback and questions  from each other and the audience.</li> <li> A <b>free format </b>session  is a session that differ from the conventional panel format. These  sessions may provide artistic and interactive avenues to learn,  debate, and co-create in transdisciplinary manners, such as artistic  performances, workshops, debates or panel discussions, or presentations  of books or films. We also invite submissions of artworks which will be  considered for live and/or virtual exhibition  and/or performance during the conference.</li> </ul><p>We also welcome proposals for <b>hybrid </b>Special Sessions of different formats, as  long as the organizer(s) of the session will be physically present at the conference. <br> <b><br> SUBMISSION INFORMATION</b></p><p> Proposals for Special Sessions must be submitted through the <b>submission platform</b> by 31 October, 2024. To be accepted for evaluation,  each proposal must include the following information:</p><ul> <li> <b>Type of Special Session: </b>Open/Closed.</li> <li> <b>Format </b>of the Special Session, as outlined in the  submission form.</li> <li> <b>Organizers:</b> full name, organization (if any), and  e-mail.</li> <li> <b>Title </b>for the proposed session.</li> <li> <b>Abstract </b>that  provides a clear description (up to  700 words) of the proposed session, including (but not limited to): i)  general presentation of the session, ii) relevance to the conference  theme, iii) format of the session, and iv) background of the session  organizer(s). Please also describe in detail any  specific logistical needs such as i) type of venue/ space requirements,  ii) equipment, iii) ideal number of presenters, iv) the optimum  duration (up to 90 minutes for each individual session), and v) any  other relevant information for the appropriate development  of the session. For interactive sessions, please include an explanation  of what audience participation may involve. (Note that while the main  language of the conference is English, it is also possible to propose to  organize Special Sessions in other broadly  used languages).</li> <li> <b>Thematic tracks: </b>a  selection of 1-2 themes that best  suits your submission. Your submission does not necessarily need to  relate to any of the predefined tracks of the conference. If this is the  case, you can specify the most relevant theme/ track under "Other".  Make sure to clearly state the relevance of your  contribution to the following overall conference themes: Ecological  Economics, Degrowth, "Building socially just postgrowth futures -  linking theory and action".</li> <li> <b>Keywords</b>: Add a minimum of 3, and a maximum of 5  keywords, related to your proposed Special Session.</li> </ul><p><b><br> EVALUATION OF SPECIAL SESSIONS</b></p><p> Proposals will be evaluated by the <a href="https://isee-degrowth2025.no/about/organizers" target="_blank">Local  Organizing Committee<span class="sr-only"> - external link</span></a> and the <a href="https://isee-degrowth2025.no/about/scientific-committee" target="_blank">Scientific  Advisory Committee<span class="sr-only"> - external link</span></a>, according to the following criteria:</p><ul> <li> Thematic relevance and relation to the overall theme of the conference.</li> <li> Quality of the proposal.</li> <li> Clarity of presentation.</li> <li> Originality and creativity.</li> <li> Academic quality (only relevant to academic contributions). </li> </ul><p> Note  that the approval of a Special Session after review does not guarantee  its final inclusion in the program. Contributions submitted  to Open Special Sessions during the abstract call, which will be  launched by December, will undergo review similar to that for regular  sessions. For an Open Special Session to be organized at the conference,  it must include at least 3 approved contributions/  abstract presentations, or the minimum number indicated in the Special  Session submission. If an Open Special Session does not reach the  minimum number of approved contributions, or does not cover a full  session slot, the conference organizing team may decide  whether to cancel the session or merge it with another related session.   </p><p><br> <br> </p><p> <b>RESPONSIBILITIES OF SPECIAL SESSION ORGANIZERS</b></p><p> Organizers will be responsible for their session, always working in cooperation with the conference organizers. Some of the organizers’ tasks include:</p><p>                    </p><ul> <li> Participating in revising and evaluating the contributions submitted for their session (Open Special Sessions only).</li> <li> Chairing the session or naming a chair.</li> <li> Giving support to the participants of the session and helping to address any questions or difficulties that may arise.</li> <li> Ensuring that participants are aware of, and follow, the sessions objectives and rules.</li> <li> Any other issues directly related to their session.</li> </ul><p>Author: Elisabeth Veivåg Helseth</p><ul> </ul>
