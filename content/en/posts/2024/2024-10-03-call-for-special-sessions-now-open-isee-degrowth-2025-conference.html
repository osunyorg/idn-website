    <p>  <br>The ISEE-Degrowth 2025 Conference is now welcoming Special Session submissions! This call will  close <br> on 31 October 2024.  <br>You can  submit  your contribution here:   https://www.conftool.pro/isee-degrowth2025/  <br>  <br>  <br> Please read the information below carefully before you make your submission.  <br>  <br>  <br>A  session  is a meeting held during a time slot in a physical place, together with other conference participants. Sessions can <br> have different formats, as described in some detail below. Each session will have a  chair  who is responsible for the session.  <br> Parallel sessions  will <br> be held during the same time slot of  1.5 hours (90 minutes). Special Sessions  will be carried out during the parallel session slots.  <br>Any person can submit a proposal for organizing a  Special Session . <br> The Special Sessions aim to give space for content with a <br> unique topic and format, and/or groups of people who want to present  <br>the progress or results of a specific project or creative contribution.  <br>These sessions can align with any of the  10 <br> predefined thematic tracks and sub-themes , or they may also bring in new themes – as long as they align with <br> the conference's overall main theme:  Building socially just postgrowth futures – linking theory and action.  <br>A Special Session can be either “open” or “closed”:  <br>  <br> Open Special Sessions  are <br> sessions of which the general <br> framing is defined by the session proposer and organizer. These  <br>sessions will be open to the participation of any applicant during the  <br>“call for abstracts” period that opens by early December.  <br>  <br> Closed Special Sessions  are <br> organized within the <br> context of a specific project that aligns with the overall theme of the <br> conference. Presenting in a closed session is by invitation only, as  <br>presenters are determined by the session proposers and organizers.  <br>  <br>All <br> applicants proposing an Open Special Session or a Closed Special  <br>Session must indicate whether their proposed session fit within <br> either the "Conventional" format or the “Free format".  <br>  <br>A  conventional  session <br> is a classical, academic panel session, in which 3-4 presenters share  <br>from their analytical work, and receive feedback and questions <br> from each other and the audience.  <br>  <br>A  free format  session <br> is a session that differ from the conventional panel format. These  <br>sessions may provide artistic and interactive avenues to learn, <br> debate, and co-create in transdisciplinary manners, such as artistic  <br>performances, workshops, debates or panel discussions, or presentations  <br>of books or films. We also invite submissions of artworks which will be  <br>considered for live and/or virtual exhibition <br> and/or performance during the conference.  <br> We also welcome proposals for  hybrid  Special Sessions of different formats, as <br> long as the organizer(s) of the session will be physically present at the conference.   <br>  <br>SUBMISSION INFORMATION  <br>Proposals for Special Sessions must be submitted through the  submission platform  by 31 October, 2024. To be accepted for evaluation, <br> each proposal must include the following information:  <br>  <br> Type of Special Session:  Open/Closed.  <br>  <br> Format  of the Special Session, as outlined in the <br> submission form.  <br>  <br> Organizers:  full name, organization (if any), and <br> e-mail.  <br>  <br> Title  for the proposed session.  <br>  <br> Abstract  that <br> provides a clear description (up to <br> 700 words) of the proposed session, including (but not limited to): i)  <br>general presentation of the session, ii) relevance to the conference  <br>theme, iii) format of the session, and iv) background of the session  <br>organizer(s). Please also describe in detail any <br> specific logistical needs such as i) type of venue/ space requirements, <br> ii) equipment, iii) ideal number of presenters, iv) the optimum  <br>duration (up to 90 minutes for each individual session), and v) any  <br>other relevant information for the appropriate development <br> of the session. For interactive sessions, please include an explanation <br> of what audience participation may involve. (Note that while the main  <br>language of the conference is English, it is also possible to propose to <br> organize Special Sessions in other broadly <br> used languages).  <br>  <br> Thematic tracks:  a <br> selection of 1-2 themes that best <br> suits your submission. Your submission does not necessarily need to  <br>relate to any of the predefined tracks of the conference.

For an Open Special Session to be organized at the conference, <br> it must include at least 3 approved contributions/ <br> abstract presentations, or the minimum number indicated in the Special  <br>Session submission. If an Open Special Session does not reach the  <br>minimum number of approved contributions, or does not cover a full  <br>session slot, the conference organizing team may decide <br> whether to cancel the session or merge it with another related session. <br>    <br>  <br>  <br> RESPONSIBILITIES OF SPECIAL SESSION ORGANIZERS  <br>Organizers will be responsible for their session, always working in cooperation with the conference organizers. <br>Some of the organizers’ tasks include: </p>  <p>  <br>  <br>Participating in revising and evaluating the contributions submitted for their session (Open Special Sessions only).  <br>  <br>Chairing the session or naming a chair.  <br>  <br>Giving support to the participants of the session and helping to address any questions or difficulties that may arise.  <br>  <br>Ensuring that participants are aware of, and follow, the sessions objectives and rules.  <br>  <br>Any other issues directly related to their session.  <br> Author: Elisabeth Veivåg Helseth </p>
