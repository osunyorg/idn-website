        <p>Arguably the biggest event on our radar since the last update was the The 5th International Assembly of the Degrowth Movement, which took place on June 17th 2024 in Pontevedra, Spain and online. It was a transformative and convivial space, with lots of complex and productive discussions taking place. You can read more about the outcomes of the assembly here <a href="https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdegrowth.net%2Fassemblies%2Fpontevedra-assembly-2024%2F&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cjuanjose.deblas%40uniper.energy%7C522366c57e4f4423fd9008dcfeba71f0%7Cdb8e2f828a374c09b7deed06547b5a20%7C0%7C0%7C638665323959224222%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=MFxW3ByqJdPfUPEDSAqZYvvmHFnbvC4FnqJGyLfenqs%3D&amp;reserved=0">https://degrowth.net/assemblies/pontevedra-assembly-2024/</a>.</p><p>We continued to grow our membership and are now up to 60 member organisations!

It also serves as a hub offering resources both for and from our members. </p><p>        </p><p>Everything we do is only possible because of the countless hours of volunteer work done by dozens of people and organisations believing in degrowth.Â </p>

This may include sharing entire personal narratives. If you prefer that we   donâ€™t use your narrative in this way, please let us know. </p><p>   </p><p>Share them in the narratives   room on Matrix, or by email to Jerome at <a href="mailto:jeroen@guts2trust.org">jeroen@guts2trust.org</a>.</p><p><b>            Social Media Diffusion   </b></p><p>Member organizations!
