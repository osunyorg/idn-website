        <p>In last month’s newsletter we promised a reflection on the Beyond Growth Conference Italia that took place in Rome on 19th and 20th of April. Now that almost a month has passed since the event, we propose some points of reflections on how it went. The articulation of the event over two days, the first one with politicians and academics, the second one with social movements, reflected the tension between the academic and institutional realm, and the engagement on the ground, which is in fact a characteristic of the degrowth movement in its various configurations and geographic locations, as well as the willingness to bridge this gap on the part of (many of) its supporters.  </p><p>As degrowth “entered the Parliament”, one wonders whether it has a real space, or it is an ephemeral presence, limited to the few hours of the event. And if it really has a space, whether it is open and participatory, or merely a formal exercise of democracy, by politicians, academics, and those citizens who have the opportunity to devote time to attend a conference. Regarding the receptibility of degrowth demands by members of the Parliament, we hope that a process has begun that can lead to the initiation of a fruitful dialogue. Deputy Luana Zanella of Green Europe, who was the host of the event, was present throughout the proceedings, and at the end declared that she would commit herself to building a parliamentary intergroup on post-growth/degrowth, one of the key goals of the Conference. However, no concrete steps in this direction have been taken to date.</p><p>The second day was titled "Beyond Growth, Beyond the Palace", precisely to indicate the desire to insert the discussions held during the afternoon in Parliament into the reality of social movements. The day was hosted by the City of the Other Economy (CAE), a venue for promoting economic practices with low environmental impact and that promote equity over profit. In this context, the goal was to create a space open to all, particularly to realities akin to degrowth, in order to create synergies, and strengthen those already existing, between the degrowth movement and all those realities engaged in the struggle for climate, environmental and social justice from a decolonial, transfeminist and anti-capitalist perspective.</p><p>The challenge before us, after this experience, is to continue to nurture the energy and synergy generated, amplifying the scope and transformative potential, so that degrowth can contribute to the pluriverse of imaginaries for an eco-social transition and to orient the various instances presented in this sense.</p><p>The Beyond Growth Blog, and Beyond Growth Italy Communication Team  </p><p>On occasion of the Beyond Growth Conference, a team was set up to create a blog for the website of the event, that included articles covering a wide range of topics related to degrowth. In the aftermath of the Conference, this group has gained new forces and showed willingness to continue its communication endeavor. They have formed a Beyond Growth communication team that also collaborates with the two Italian Degrowth movements, Associazione Decrescita and the Movimento per la Decrescita Felice (about which you can find more information below). They publish weekly articles that you can find on the<a href="https://beyondgrowth.it/news"> News</a> section of the Conference’s website, alongside Instagram posts shared through the<a href="https://www.instagram.com/associazionedecrescita/"> profile</a> of Associazione Decrescita. The aim of the group, especially through social media, is to make accessible content about degrowth themes, to reach both people and collectives that are already engaged in similar struggles, and the general public.</p><p>If you would like to join, write to: comunicazione@decrescita.it</p>
