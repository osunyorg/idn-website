        <p><b>Global Climate Strike</b>, Friday April 19th, 2024</p><p>● The European Circle of IDN sent a collaboration proposal for future actions together with Fridays for Future (FFF) Europe. Different meetings with local and national groups (e.g. FFF Netherlands) are being planned.</p><p>● More than 500 demos across the whole World went to the streets with the slogans “#ClimateJusticeNow” and “Fight with us for a world worth living in”.</p><p>● The Italian Degrowth Movement(s) and FFF collaborated officially for the march of the 19th of may in Rome, and a lot of FFF activists joined the conference, showing the beginning of a Degrowth contamination in the youth movement. Here are some pictures from the protest!</p><p><b>Beyond Growth Conference 2024 </b>in Italy, Friday 19th and Saturday 20th of April </p><p>On April 19th and 20th, the Beyond Growth Conference Italy 2024 took place in Rome, organized by the Movement per La Decrescita Felice (MDF), Associazione per la Decrescita, WellBeing Economy Alliance, Friends of the Earth Europe, Partners for a New Economy, and European Environmental Bureau. Its aim was to bring the themes and issues discussed at the event held at the European Parliament in Brussels in May 2023 to our national parliament. It provided a space for activists, politicians, associations, NGOs, and citizens to gather and reflect on the necessity and methods of transitioning to a socio-economic model oriented towards the well-being of people rather than economic growth. Although inspired by the Brussels event, the two-day conference in Rome on April 19-20 differed in many aspects from its European version. The first day began with a demonstration organized by Fridays for Future (FFF) on the occasion of the global climate strike on April 19th. The presence of a degrowth segment in the protest aimed to show solidarity with FFF and share the demands of the movement, such as “Lavori Climatici” (Green Job Guarantee). A priority for the organizers was to give the event a participatory and, as far as possible, informal character that went beyond involvement from the academic and political worlds to include active participation from citizens. The desire not to remain confined within the walls of Parliament also emerged from the name given to the second day, "Beyond Growth and Beyond the Palace: Degrowth, Transformation, and Social Movements," which saw representatives of social movements active in climate, environmental, and social justice gather along with activist-academics and citizens.</p><p>In the next newsletter, the organizers of the conference will write a more elaborate reflection on how the conference went, what went well and less well, and about the next steps. We think that a new format of conferences that look less like conferences and more like activist gatherings and assemblies is needed to take degrowth outside of the few hands of us degrowthers. In the meanwhile support us by following our social media pages, spreading the reels and the pictures from the conference and stay tuned for some exciting new events!</p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/associazionedecrescita/" target="_blank">https://www.instagram.com/associazionedecrescita/</a> <br></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/ass_decrescita" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/ass_decrescita</a> </p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/" target="_blank">https://www.linkedin.com/feed/</a> </p><p><b>Wanna join the movement?</b></p><p>● Join this Telegram channel with news about next Beyond Growth Italia events:</p><p><a href="https://t.me/+qCxB7lBhPx4zNzZk" target="_blank">https://t.me/+qCxB7lBhPx4zNzZk</a> </p><p>● Join the Telegram channel for Italian International (and not) Degrowthers:</p><p><a href="https://web.telegram.org/a/#-948599375" target="_blank">https://web.telegram.org/a/#-948599375</a> </p><p>● A form to fill to get more actively involved: https://forms.gle/ZisCvsreaExRWGow6</p><p> </p>
