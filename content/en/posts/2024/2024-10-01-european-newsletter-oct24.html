      GreenFormation - Hungary

        <p><b>What are the main objectives of the group? </b></p><p>We consist of dedicated individuals with a diverse background ranging from ecology through economy and policy to geography. We focus on biodiversity, the well-being of society, sufficient energy use, socio-economic transition and transformation as well as behavior change. </p><p>For this we carry out research, we measure impacts, we provide advice and we do projects. We involve multiple stakeholders, we build dialogues and bridges. We bring experience and networks from both Western and Eastern Europe.</p><p><b>Where are you active geographically? (country/cities)</b></p><p>Europe-wide, but we are located in Budapest. </p><p><b>Since when have you been active?</b> 2023 January</p><p><b>How many members are you? </b>Currently, we have only one employee, but from next year on due to our Horizon projects (including one degrowth related), we will expand to 6 employees. </p><p><b>How are you organized?:</b> We are a tiny consultancy firm, with three women founders, where everyone has the same voice to make decisions. </p><p><b>Main events/actions carried out: </b></p><p>Understanding individual and institutional choices and behaviour, will help understand how our society steers for an (un)sustainable future. In light of this, we carry out ground-breaking research on biodiversity and behaviour to drive social transition and transformation within sectors and society. We identify policy entry points and leverage points at various levels and advocate for just transition and societal change will induce transformation. We aim to contribute to a network of transformation scientists and practitioners EU-wide focusing on climate and biodiversity issues through international projects.</p><p>Furthermore, we have been carrying out research and advocated for sufficient energy use at UN and EU level for almost 20 years. We analyse the national household energy use of Central and Eastern European countries. We raise the energy sufficiency profiles of international organizations and projects focusing on alleviating energy poverty. We have evaluated national and international energy related programmes from an energy sufficiency point of view. We have developed and disseminated an interactive, awareness raising game towards the needed socio-economic transformation (www.decarbonisegame.com). </p><p>Currently, using the experience of the Hungarian Degrowth Doughnut development, GreenFormation contributes to the work of the Corvinus University of Budapest in creating Budapest’s Degrowth Doughnut in a participatory way. Our goal is to use this framework to analyse the capital’s potential in ecological and social sustainability transition. The analysis reveals gaps, strengths, unexploited opportunities, and correlations between individual indicators. The outcome of the participatory Degrowth Doughnut model development is to provide directions for the municipality on how to move towards social and ecological sustainability.</p><p><b>Plans for the future: </b></p><p>Within one Horizon project, we aim to understand how interventions can drive systemic change and transformation for biodiversity and equity, by offering concrete policy recommendations. We will contribute to analyse social, economic, and political processes, map existing approaches, assess their transformative potential, and develop, test and assess interventions to be taken up by policies to address biodiversity loss and equity. Through the realised case studies (spanning from using digital apps through commons governance to degrowth models), organised workshops, and conducted (social science) experiments, we will work collaboratively with a range of participants. Additionally, we will foster collaboration with key networks and across a range of domains to amplify its impact.</p><p>Furthermore, we aim to work further on Degrowth Doughnut development for other municipalities beside the Hungarian capital, while monitoring Budapest model proper implementation. </p><p><b>Links to social media/website: </b></p><ul> <li>Website https://greenformation.net/</li> <li>X (former Twitter) https://x.com/ecosystemevalu1 </li> <li>LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/104595561 </li> </ul><p><b>Connections with IDN:</b> GreenFormation is a member of the IDN and has nominated one representative, @veronika.gf , that collaborates in the European Circle, as well as in the Research Working Group Circles. </p><p>**Group photo: **</p>
