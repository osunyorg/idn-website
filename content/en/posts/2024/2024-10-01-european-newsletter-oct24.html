        <p><b>Portugal:</b></p><ul><li><b>2nd-6th Sep: X International Congress of Agroecology </b></li></ul><p>It was held in Viseu, Portugal under the motto Agroecologies of the World, United to face the global crises. The pre-congress course on Agroecological Communication was held on 2nd and 3rd September with approximately 100 participants. The congress, on 4th, 5th and 6th September, was attended by nearly 400 participants from 24 countries. The congress was marked by the importance of sharing, both from academia and civil society: scientific papers (137), reports of experiences (101), artistic interventions (8) and round tables (7) were presented, all of which can be found in the congress proceedings book available at the following link: <a href="https://events.ipv.pt/xcia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://events.ipv.pt/xcia/ <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a> . This event was characterized by a sharing and co-construction dynamic, with a large number of participants in the organization (both logistical and scientific) of the congress and the pre-congress course.</p><p>Held for the first time in Portugal, the congress succeeded in bringing together participants from Africa, Latin America and Europe. As a result of the congress, the agroecological movement in Portugal was consolidated, the first steps were taken towards an ‘Iberian agroecology non-network’, and there was a desire to strengthen relations between the countries of the Global South (Africa and Latin America). In the end, there was a reflection on the importance of not compartmentalizing agroecology into its practice, movement and science dimensions, since it is the synergy between them that makes agroecology occur, and that this should be reflected in agroecological sharing’s, from the smallest to the largest. The congress organizing committee, composed of people from Europe (Portugal and Spain), Latin America (Chile and Mexico) and Africa (Cape Verde, São Tomé and Príncipe and Mozambique) will continue in the organization of the XI International Congress of Agroecology to be held in Mozambique in 2026.</p><p>Inês Costa Pereira & Cristina Amaro da Costa</p><p>Organizing Committee of the X International Congress of Agroecology – local team coordination</p><ul><li> <b>21st Sep: Feminismos e Decrescimento (Feminisms and Degrowth)</b><br> </li></ul><p> <a href="https://www.decrescimento.pt/events/feminismos-decrescimento-coimbra/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://www.decrescimento.pt/events/feminismos-decrescimento-coimbra/ <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a>  </p><p>After a welcome by Filipa Alves from Casa da Esquina and Susana Ribeira from the Ecofeminism Circle of the Portuguese Degrowth Network, Hans Eickhoff gave an introduction to degrowth and the Portuguese network. Graça Rojão moderated the conversation with Djamila Andrade (<a href="https://ces.uc.pt/en/doutoramentos/doutorandos-as/djamila-andrade" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://ces.uc.pt/en/doutoramentos/doutorandos-as/djamila-andrade <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a>), ecofeminist and researcher at the Center for Social Studies at the University of Coimbra, and Joacine Katar Moreira, intersectional feminist and former member of parliament (<a href="https://independent.academia.edu/JoacineKatarMoreira" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://independent.academia.edu/JoacineKatarMoreira <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a>). The afternoon workshop on focused on integrating feminist and degrowth perspectives into local organizations and social movements. Vanessa Marcos from the Ecofeminism Circle gave the closing remarks, emphasizing the need for collaboration between social movements and the importance of creating "community".</p>

        <p><b>What are the main objectives of the group? </b></p><p>We consist of dedicated individuals with a diverse background ranging from ecology through economy and policy to geography. We focus on biodiversity, the well-being of society, sufficient energy use, socio-economic transition and transformation as well as behavior change. </p><p>For this we carry out research, we measure impacts, we provide advice and we do projects. We involve multiple stakeholders, we build dialogues and bridges. We bring experience and networks from both Western and Eastern Europe.</p><p><b>Where are you active geographically? (country/cities)</b></p><p>Europe-wide, but we are located in Budapest. </p><p><b>Since when have you been active?</b> 2023 January</p><p><b>How many members are you? </b>Currently, we have only one employee, but from next year on due to our Horizon projects (including one degrowth related), we will expand to 6 employees. </p><p><b>How are you organized?:</b> We are a tiny consultancy firm, with three women founders, where everyone has the same voice to make decisions. </p><p><b>Main events/actions carried out: </b></p><p>Understanding individual and institutional choices and behaviour, will help understand how our society steers for an (un)sustainable future. In light of this, we carry out ground-breaking research on biodiversity and behaviour to drive social transition and transformation within sectors and society. We identify policy entry points and leverage points at various levels and advocate for just transition and societal change will induce transformation. We aim to contribute to a network of transformation scientists and practitioners EU-wide focusing on climate and biodiversity issues through international projects.</p><p>Furthermore, we have been carrying out research and advocated for sufficient energy use at UN and EU level for almost 20 years. We analyse the national household energy use of Central and Eastern European countries. We raise the energy sufficiency profiles of international organizations and projects focusing on alleviating energy poverty. We have evaluated national and international energy related programmes from an energy sufficiency point of view. We have developed and disseminated an interactive, awareness raising game towards the needed socio-economic transformation (www.decarbonisegame.com). </p><p>Currently, using the experience of the Hungarian Degrowth Doughnut development, GreenFormation contributes to the work of the Corvinus University of Budapest in creating Budapest’s Degrowth Doughnut in a participatory way. Our goal is to use this framework to analyse the capital’s potential in ecological and social sustainability transition. The analysis reveals gaps, strengths, unexploited opportunities, and correlations between individual indicators. The outcome of the participatory Degrowth Doughnut model development is to provide directions for the municipality on how to move towards social and ecological sustainability.</p><p><b>Plans for the future: </b></p><p>Within one Horizon project, we aim to understand how interventions can drive systemic change and transformation for biodiversity and equity, by offering concrete policy recommendations. We will contribute to analyse social, economic, and political processes, map existing approaches, assess their transformative potential, and develop, test and assess interventions to be taken up by policies to address biodiversity loss and equity. Through the realised case studies (spanning from using digital apps through commons governance to degrowth models), organised workshops, and conducted (social science) experiments, we will work collaboratively with a range of participants. Additionally, we will foster collaboration with key networks and across a range of domains to amplify its impact.</p><p>Furthermore, we aim to work further on Degrowth Doughnut development for other municipalities beside the Hungarian capital, while monitoring Budapest model proper implementation. </p><p><b>Links to social media/website: </b></p><ul> <li>Website: <a href="https://greenformation.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://greenformation.net/ <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a> </li> <li>X (former Twitter): <a href="https://x.com/ecosystemevalu1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://x.com/ecosystemevalu1 <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a>   </li> <li>LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/104595561    </li> </ul><p><b>Connections with IDN:</b> GreenFormation is a member of the IDN and has nominated one representative, @veronika.gf , that collaborates in the European Circle, as well as in the Research Working Group Circles. </p><p><b>Group photo: </b></p>
