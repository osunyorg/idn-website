      <p>Join through one of our member organisations. Individuals who are already part of an organisation that is a member of the network are considered members of the IDN. Once you belong to one of IDN's member organisations, you will be connected to the rest of the IDN through the people your organisation has selected to be its delegates. <br>(You may also want to browse this database of hundreds of degrowth groups and contact them directly to see how to get involved with them, but please note that not all groups have applied to become members of the IDN or have agreed to our principles yet.)</p>  <p>Join as an individual member. If you would like to get involved in the IDN directly by joining one of our circles, you will need to fill out the form below. <br>Before applying for membership, please make sure you’ve read and agree with the IDN principles and have a basic understanding of the overall IDN structure. Then, please fill in the form below so we can get to know you better and connect you with the rest of the network. </p>  <p>   <br>If you have any questions about becoming a member please contact the Membership and Onboarding Circle: join@degrowth.net </p>
